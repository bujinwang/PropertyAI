# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current tenant ratings page in the PropertyAI Dashboard lacks proper user experience design, visual appeal, and essential functionality. The page appears basic with unstyled HTML elements, poor layout, and limited features. This enhancement will transform it into a professional, user-friendly interface that allows property managers to effectively rate tenants, view rating histories, and manage tenant evaluations with proper visual design and intuitive interactions.

1. WHEN the tenant ratings page loads THEN the system SHALL display a modern, Material-UI styled interface with proper spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
2. WHEN viewing the page THEN the system SHALL show a clean layout with distinct sections for tenant selection, rating submission, and ratings display

4. WHEN the page is responsive THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately for different screen sizes

### Requirement 2

3. WHEN I select a tenant THEN the system SHALL automatically populate the tenant information and load their existing ratings
4. WHEN no tenant is selected THEN the system SHALL disable the rating submission form

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a property manager, I want to submit tenant ratings with multiple criteria and rich feedback, so that I can provide comprehensive evaluations beyond just a single star rating.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting a rating THEN the system SHALL allow me to rate multiple categories (cleanliness, communication, payment history, property care)
2. WHEN providing feedback THEN the system SHALL offer a rich text editor for detailed comments
3. WHEN selecting ratings THEN the system SHALL display interactive star rating components for each category
4. WHEN submitting THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields and show clear error messages
5. WHEN submission is successful THEN the system SHALL show a success notification and clear the form

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a property manager, I want to view tenant rating histories in an organized, filterable format, so that I can quickly assess tenant performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing ratings THEN the system SHALL display ratings in a card-based layout with clear visual separation
2. WHEN multiple ratings exist THEN the system SHALL show ratings sorted by date with pagination or infinite scroll
3. WHEN viewing rating details THEN the system SHALL display all rating categories, comments, rater information, and timestamps
4. WHEN ratings are displayed THEN the system SHALL show average ratings with visual indicators (progress bars or charts)
5. WHEN filtering is needed THEN the system SHALL provide options to filter by date range, rating score, or rater

### Requirement 5

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading spinners or skeleton screens
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL show user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
3. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry options and offline indicators
4. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic fields with clear error text

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a property manager, I want the tenant ratings to integrate with the existing dashboard design system, so that the interface feels consistent with the rest of the application.
