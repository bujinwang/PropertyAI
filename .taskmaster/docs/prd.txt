# PropertyAI - Authentication & Security Enhancement PRD

## Project Overview
PropertyAI is a property management system that requires robust authentication and security features. This PRD focuses on completing the frontend integration for authentication, implementing additional security features, and testing the system.

## Core Requirements

### Frontend Integration
1. Create an MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) setup screen for users to enable MFA
   - Allow users to toggle MFA on/off
   - Provide clear instructions for setup process
   - Display backup codes for account recovery

2. Add QR code generation for authenticator apps
   - Generate QR codes compatible with standard authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy)
   - Provide manual entry option with displayed secret key
   - Include verification step to confirm successful setup

3. Implement OAuth login buttons in the login screen
   - Support multiple OAuth providers (Google, Facebook, etc.)
   - Create consistent UI for OAuth buttons
   - Handle OAuth flow and redirect properly

### Security Features
1. Implement rate limiting for login attempts
   - Limit consecutive failed login attempts
   - Implement progressive delays between attempts
   - Log and monitor suspicious activity

2. Add account lockout functionality
   - Lock accounts after specified number of failed attempts
   - Provide clear user feedback about lockout status
   - Implement secure account recovery process

3. Create password reset flow with email verification
   - Generate secure, time-limited reset tokens
   - Send password reset emails with verification links
   - Implement secure password change form
   - Notify users when password is changed

### Testing Requirements
1. Test full authentication flow
   - Verify standard username/password login
   - Test OAuth login flow with different providers
   - Validate MFA verification process

2. Verify token validation and session handling
   - Test token expiration and refresh
   - Validate secure storage of tokens
   - Test session timeout and logout functionality

3. Test MFA setup on various devices and authenticator apps
   - Verify compatibility with Google Authenticator, Authy, and other apps
   - Test backup code functionality
   - Verify MFA works across different devices

## Technical Constraints
- Frontend is built with React Native
- Backend uses Node.js with Express
- Authentication system uses JWT tokens
- MFA implementation uses TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- Database includes PostgreSQL and MongoDB

## Success Criteria
- Users can successfully set up MFA through the dedicated screen
- QR codes are correctly generated and work with standard authenticator apps
- OAuth login is seamlessly integrated with the existing authentication flow
- Rate limiting and account lockout protect against brute force attacks
- Password reset flow securely allows users to recover their accounts
- All authentication flows pass security testing
