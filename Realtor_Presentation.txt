## Slide 2: The Problem

**The Challenges of Modern Property Management**

*   **Administrative Overload:** Drowning in paperwork, emails, and phone calls? The average property manager spends over 60% of their time on administrative tasks.
*   **Tenant Turnover:** The high cost of finding and screening reliable tenants. A single eviction can cost thousands of dollars and months of lost rent.
*   **Maintenance Headaches:** Juggling maintenance requests and dealing with unexpected, costly repairs. Reactive maintenance is a budget killer.
*   **Market Blind Spots:** Making critical investment decisions without real-time, data-driven insights. Are you leaving money on the table?
*   **Staying Competitive:** The real estate market is evolving. Keeping up with technology, trends, and tenant expectations is a full-time job.

**Speaker Notes:**
> "As a realtor, you know these challenges all too well, either from your own experience or from your clients'. The administrative burden, the financial drain of tenant turnover, the constant stress of maintenance, and the fear of missing out on market opportunities. These are the problems that keep property owners and managers up at night."
