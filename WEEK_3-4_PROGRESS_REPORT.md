# Week 3-4: Mobile Enhancements - Progress Report

## 📊 Current Status

**Phase**: Week 3-4 Mobile Enhancements  
**Progress**: 85% Complete (Token Refresh ✅, Network Detection ✅, Sync Queue 90%)  
**Session**: 2 of estimated 5-6 sessions  
**Date**: 2024-01-06 (Updated)

---

## ✅ Completed Across Sessions

### Task 1: Token Refresh Implementation ✅ (100% Complete)

#### ✅ Phase 1: Centralized HTTP Client
**Status**: Complete  
**Commit**: `1da00a0` - "feat: Implement centralized HTTP client with automatic token refresh"

**What Was Built**:

1. **httpClient.ts** - New centralized HTTP service (210 lines)
   - Singleton axios instance with comprehensive interceptors
   - Automatic JWT token injection from SecureStore
   - Automatic token refresh on 401 errors
   - **Request deduplication** - Multiple concurrent 401s trigger only ONE refresh
   - Automatic retry of failed requests after refresh
   - Secure token storage integration
   - Clean error handling and logging

**Key Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Request Interceptor: Automatic token injection
- ✅ Response Interceptor: 401 detection and refresh trigger
- ✅ Token Refresh Flow: Calls `/auth/refresh` endpoint
- ✅ Request Deduplication: Prevents refresh stampede
- ✅ Auto-retry: Failed requests retry with new token
- ✅ Secure Storage: expo-secure-store integration
- ✅ Session Management: Auto-logout on refresh failure

**Services Updated (3/3)**:
- ✅ `maintenanceService.ts` - Removed 50 lines of duplicate auth code
- ✅ `propertyService.ts` - Removed 55 lines of duplicate auth code
- ✅ `paymentService.ts` - Removed 51 lines of duplicate auth code

**Benefits**:
- **DRY Principle**: One auth implementation instead of duplicating in every service
- **Consistency**: All services now use identical auth/refresh logic
- **Maintainability**: Auth logic changes only need to update one file
- **Performance**: Request deduplication prevents token refresh storms
- **Security**: Centralized secure token storage

---

### Task 2: Network Detection ✅ (100% Complete)

**Status**: Complete  
**Commit**: `1624e23` - "feat: Implement network detection and offline sync queue"

**What Was Built**:

1. **NetworkContext.tsx** - Updated with real NetInfo integration
   - Real-time network state monitoring
   - `isConnected`, `isInternetReachable`, `type` states
   - Automatic subscription to network state changes
   - Proper cleanup on unmount
   - Debug logging in development mode

**Key Features Implemented**:
- ✅ NetInfo integration from @react-native-community/netinfo
- ✅ Initial network state fetch on mount
- ✅ Real-time network change detection
- ✅ Connection type detection (wifi, cellular, none, unknown)
- ✅ Internet reachability checking
- ✅ TypeScript types with NetInfoStateType
- ✅ Proper subscription cleanup

---

### Task 3: Offline Sync Queue (90% Complete)

**Status**: Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Pending  
**Commit**: `1624e23` - "feat: Implement network detection and offline sync queue"

**What Was Built**:

1. **syncQueueService.ts** - Comprehensive offline sync service (372 lines)
   - Request queuing with persistent storage (AsyncStorage)
   - Exponential backoff retry logic with jitter
   - Request metadata tracking (entity type, ID, description)
   - Subscription system for UI updates
   - Queue management (add, remove, clear, get)

2. **MaintenanceScreen.tsx** - Integrated sync queue
   - Failed API calls now queue for retry
   - Auto-process queue when network reconnects
   - Metadata tracking for maintenance updates

**Key Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Persistent queue with AsyncStorage
- ✅ Exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s... up to 60s)
- ✅ Jitter to prevent thundering herd problem
- ✅ Request deduplication by ID
- ✅ Metadata tracking (entityType, entityId, description)
- ✅ Subscription system for queue changes
- ✅ Auto-processing on network reconnect
- ✅ Max retry limit (configurable, default 5)
- ✅ Queue persistence across app restarts

**Benefits**:
- **Offline-First**: Users can work offline, changes sync when online
- **Resilient**: Failed requests automatically retry with backoff
- **Transparent**: Users see their changes immediately, sync happens in background
- **Debuggable**: Metadata tracks what each queued request is for

## 🚧 In Progress

### Task 3: Offline Sync Queue (Remaining 10%)

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Update PaymentsScreen to use sync queue

### Task 4: Mobile Detail Screens (Optional)
**Estimated**: 2-3 days  
**Priority**: LOW (Nice to have)

**Optional enhancements** - These can be done as time permits.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Token Refresh Flow

```
Request → 401 Error → Check if refresh in progress
                    ↓
              Start refresh (or wait for existing)
                    ↓
         Call /auth/refresh with refresh token
                    ↓
         Store new tokens in SecureStore
                    ↓
         Retry original request with new token
                    ↓
              Return response
```

### Request Deduplication

```typescript
private refreshPromise: Promise<string> | null = null;

private async handleTokenRefresh(): Promise<string> {
  // If refresh already in progress, wait for it
  if (this.refreshPromise) {
    return this.refreshPromise;
  }
  
  // Start new refresh
  this.refreshPromise = this.performTokenRefresh();
  
  try {
    const token = await this.refreshPromise;
    return token;
  } finally {
    // Clear when done
    this.refreshPromise = null;
  }
}
```

**Why This Matters**: If 5 API calls fail with 401 simultaneously, only ONE refresh call is made, and all 5 requests wait for the same refresh to complete.

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Completed:
- ✅ Centralized auth implementation
- ✅ 3 service files refactored
- ✅ 156 lines of duplicate code removed
- ✅ Token refresh with deduplication
- ✅ Automatic request retry

### In Progress:
- 🟡 Complete token refresh testing
- 🟡 Update remaining services (if any)

### Not Started:
- ⬜ Offline sync queue
- ⬜ Network detection
- ⬜ Mobile detail screens

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

### What Went Well:
- ✅ httpClient pattern cleanly separates concerns
- ✅ Request deduplication prevents token refresh storms
- ✅ Services dramatically simplified (50+ lines removed each)
- ✅ Single source of truth for auth logic

### Challenges Encountered:
- Ensuring the refresh endpoint doesn't trigger interceptor (infinite loop)
  - **Solution**: Use axios.post directly without interceptors for refresh call

### Best Practices Applied:
- **Singleton Pattern**: One httpClient instance for entire app
- **Promise Deduplication**: Prevent concurrent refresh calls
- **Separation of Concerns**: Auth logic separate from business logic
- **Secure Storage**: expo-secure-store for sensitive tokens
