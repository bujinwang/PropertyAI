# AI Orchestration Service

This document outlines the design and implementation of the AI Orchestration Service for the PropertyFlow AI platform.

## Overview

The AI Orchestration Service is responsible for managing and coordinating all AI-powered workflows within the platform. It acts as a central hub for all AI-related tasks, ensuring that they are executed efficiently and reliably.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Workflow Management:** Define and manage complex AI workflows that involve multiple AI models and services.
- **Task Queuing:** Queue AI tasks to be processed asynchronously.
- **Model Management:** Manage the lifecycle of AI models, including deployment, versioning, and monitoring.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess data before it is sent to AI models for inference.
- **Result Caching:** Cache AI model results to improve performance and reduce costs.
- **Error Handling:** Handle errors and failures in AI workflows gracefully.
- **Scalability:** Scale AI workflows to handle a large number of requests.

## Architecture

The AI Orchestration Service will be implemented as a separate microservice. It will expose a REST API for other services to submit AI tasks. The service will use a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ) to queue and process tasks asynchronously.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing task metadata and results
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes

## Implementation Details

The AI Orchestration Service will be implemented in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Basic Workflow Management

- Implement a basic workflow engine that can execute simple AI workflows.
- Implement a task queue using RabbitMQ.
- Implement a REST API for submitting AI tasks.

### Phase 2: Advanced Workflow Management

- Implement support for complex AI workflows that involve multiple AI models and services.
- Implement a model registry for managing AI models.
- Implement a result cache to improve performance.

### Phase 3: Scalability and Reliability

- Implement auto-scaling for AI workflows.
- Implement a dead-letter queue for handling failed tasks.
- Implement a monitoring and alerting system for AI workflows.
