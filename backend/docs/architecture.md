# PropertyFlow AI - Microservices Architecture

This document outlines the microservices architecture for the PropertyFlow AI platform.

## Guiding Principles

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Each microservice is aligned with a specific business domain.
- **Loose Coupling:** Services are independent and communicate through well-defined APIs.
- **High Cohesion:** Each service has a clear and focused responsibility.
- **Scalability:** Services can be scaled independently based on demand.
- **Resilience:** Failure in one service should not cascade to others.

## Service Boundaries

The PropertyFlow AI platform will be composed of the following microservices:

- **Users Service:** Manages user accounts, authentication, and authorization.
- **Properties Service:** Manages property information, including units, amenities, and photos.
- **Listings Service:** Manages property listings, including pricing, availability, and publishing to external platforms.
- **Applications Service:** Manages tenant applications, including screening and background checks.
- **Leases Service:** Manages lease agreements, including rent payments and renewals.
- **Maintenance Service:** Manages maintenance requests, including work orders and vendor assignments.
- **Communications Service:** Manages all communications, including emails, SMS, and chat messages.
- **AI Service:** Provides AI-powered features, such as text generation, image analysis, and predictive analytics.
- **Payments Service:** Manages all financial transactions, including rent payments and vendor payouts.

## Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous Communication:** Services will communicate synchronously using REST APIs for requests that require an immediate response.
- **Asynchronous Communication:** Services will communicate asynchronously using a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for events and long-running processes.

## Data Management

- **Database per Service:** Each microservice will have its own dedicated database to ensure loose coupling.
- **Data Consistency:** Eventual consistency will be achieved using asynchronous communication and event-driven patterns.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL for structured data, MongoDB for unstructured data
- **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
