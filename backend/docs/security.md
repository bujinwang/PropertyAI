# Zero-Trust Security Framework

This document outlines the initial zero-trust security framework for the PropertyFlow AI platform.

## Guiding Principles

- **Never Trust, Always Verify:** Assume no user or device is trusted by default, regardless of its location.
- **Least Privilege:** Grant users and services only the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks.
- **Micro-segmentation:** Divide the network into small, isolated segments to limit the blast radius of a security breach.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require multiple forms of authentication for all users.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously monitor all network traffic and user activity for suspicious behavior.

## Implementation Details

### Authentication

- **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies for all users.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all user accounts.
- **OAuth 2.0:** Use OAuth 2.0 for third-party authentication.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Use JWTs for API authentication.

### Authorization

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to control access to resources based on user roles.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Use ABAC to control access to resources based on user attributes.

### Network Security

- **Micro-segmentation:** Use network segmentation to isolate services from each other.
- **Firewalls:** Use firewalls to restrict network traffic between services.
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):** Use IDPS to detect and prevent network attacks.

### Data Security

- **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt all data at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
- **Encryption in Transit:** Encrypt all data in transit using TLS.
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Use DLP to prevent sensitive data from leaving the network.

### Application Security

- **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Use SAST to identify security vulnerabilities in source code.
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Use DAST to identify security vulnerabilities in running applications.

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Centralized Logging:** Use a centralized logging system to collect and analyze logs from all services.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Use a SIEM to correlate and analyze security events.
- **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA):** Use UEBA to detect anomalous user behavior.

# Data Privacy, Compliance, and Ethical AI Considerations

## Data Privacy Compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- **Data Minimization:** Only collect and process data strictly necessary for tenant screening and analytics.
- **User Consent:** Obtain explicit user consent for data collection and processing where required.
- **Right to Access/Delete:** Provide mechanisms for users to access, correct, or request deletion of their data.
- **Data Retention:** Define and enforce data retention policies; delete or anonymize data when no longer needed.
- **Audit Trails:** Maintain detailed logs of data access, changes, and deletion requests for compliance audits.

## Model and API Security
- **Access Controls:** Restrict access to predictive analytics APIs and model endpoints using RBAC/ABAC and JWT authentication.
- **Audit Logging:** Log all access to sensitive model endpoints and prediction requests for traceability.
- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor model APIs for unusual access patterns or abuse.

## Ethical AI (Bias, Fairness, Explainability)
- **Bias Monitoring:** Regularly evaluate predictive models for bias, especially in protected attributes (e.g., race, gender, age).
- **Fairness Checks:** Implement fairness metrics and review model outputs for disparate impact.
- **Explainability:** Provide explanations for model predictions (e.g., SHAP, LIME) in tenant screening decisions.
- **Transparency:** Document model logic, data sources, and limitations for stakeholders and users.

## Compliance Documentation and Review
- **Periodic Reviews:** Conduct regular security, privacy, and ethical AI reviews of all analytics and screening systems.
- **Privacy Impact Assessments:** Perform DPIAs for new or significantly changed data processing activities.
- **User-Facing Documentation:** Maintain clear, accessible privacy and AI transparency documentation for end users.
