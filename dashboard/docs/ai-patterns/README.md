# AI Interaction Pattern Mockups and Design Guidelines

This document outlines the mockups and design guidelines for AI-specific interaction patterns across the PropertyFlow platform.

## 1. AI Suggestion Presentation Patterns

**Objective:** Clearly distinguish AI-generated content from user-generated content.

**Guidelines:**
- Use a distinct background color or border for AI-generated content.
- Prepend AI-generated text with a "Sparkle" icon to indicate its origin.
- Use a consistent "AI Suggestion" label for all AI-generated content.

## 2. Confidence Level Indicators

**Objective:** Represent the confidence level of AI predictions.

**Guidelines:**
- Use a color-coded bar to represent the confidence level (e.g., green for high, yellow for medium, red for low).
- Display a numerical score (e.g., "85% confident") next to the bar.
- Provide a tooltip with a more detailed explanation of the confidence level.

## 3. Feedback Mechanisms

**Objective:** Allow users to provide feedback on AI accuracy.

**Guidelines:**
- Use a simple thumbs-up/thumbs-down icon for quick feedback.
- Provide an optional open-ended text field for more detailed feedback.
- Place feedback mechanisms in a consistent, unobtrusive location.

## 4. Loading and Processing States

**Objective:** Indicate when AI operations are in progress.

**Guidelines:**
- Use a loading spinner or progress bar to indicate that an AI operation is in progress.
- Provide an estimated completion time when possible.
- Use subtle animations to avoid distracting the user.

## 5. Explanation Interfaces

**Objective:** Explain AI decisions and recommendations.

**Guidelines:**
- Use tooltips or pop-up windows to provide brief explanations.
- For more complex explanations, use a dedicated explanation panel.
- Use clear, concise, and non-technical language.

## 6. Progressive Disclosure Patterns

**Objective:** Gradually reveal complex AI capabilities to users.

**Guidelines:**
- Start with simple explanations and basic features.
- Provide options for users to explore more advanced functionalities.
- Use tooltips, tutorials, and documentation to guide users through the learning process.

## 7. Notification Approaches

**Objective:** Design notification approaches for proactive AI insights.

**Guidelines:**
- Use banners, badges, or in-app messages for proactive AI insights.
- Ensure that notifications are relevant, timely, and non-intrusive.
- Provide options for users to customize their notification preferences.
