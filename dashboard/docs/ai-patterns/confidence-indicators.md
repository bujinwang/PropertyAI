# Confidence Level Indicators

This document outlines the design patterns for visualizing the confidence level of AI predictions.

## Rationale

It is important to provide users with an indication of the AI's confidence in its predictions and suggestions. This helps users to make more informed decisions and to understand the limitations of the AI.

## Core Components

- **`ConfidenceIndicator`**: A component to display the confidence level of an AI suggestion.

## Patterns

### 1. Color-Coded Bars

- **Use Case:** Displaying a continuous confidence level.
- **Pattern:**
    - Use a linear progress bar to represent the confidence level.
    - Use color-coding to indicate the confidence level (e.g., green for high, yellow for medium, red for low).

### 2. Numerical Scores

- **Use Case:** Displaying a precise confidence level.
- **Pattern:**
    - Display a numerical score (e.g., "85% confident") next to the suggestion.
    - Use a consistent format for all numerical scores.

### 3. Descriptive Labels

- **Use Case:** Providing a more qualitative indication of the confidence level.
- **Pattern:**
    - Use descriptive labels (e.g., "High Confidence," "Medium Confidence," "Low Confidence") to indicate the confidence level.
    - Use a consistent set of labels across the platform.

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Color Contrast:** Ensure that the colors used for confidence level indicators have sufficient contrast to be accessible to users with visual impairments.
- **Screen Readers:** Use ARIA attributes to ensure that screen readers can identify and announce the confidence level.
