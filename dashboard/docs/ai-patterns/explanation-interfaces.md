# Explanation Interfaces for AI Decisions

This document outlines the design patterns for explaining AI decisions and recommendations to users.

## Rationale

It is important to provide users with transparency into how the AI makes decisions. This helps to build trust and to allow users to understand the reasoning behind the AI's suggestions.

## Core Components

- **Tooltips:** For brief, contextual explanations.
- **Pop-up Windows:** For more detailed explanations.
- **Dedicated Explanation Panels:** For comprehensive explanations of complex decisions.

## Patterns

### 1. Tooltips

- **Use Case:** For providing brief, contextual explanations of AI suggestions.
- **Pattern:**
    - Display a tooltip when the user hovers over an AI-generated suggestion.
    - The tooltip should provide a concise explanation of the factors that influenced the suggestion.

### 2. Pop-up Windows

- **Use Case:** For providing more detailed explanations of AI decisions.
- **Pattern:**
    - Provide a link or button to open a pop-up window with a more detailed explanation.
    - The pop-up window should present the explanation in a clear, non-technical language.

### 3. Dedicated Explanation Panels

- **Use Case:** For providing comprehensive explanations of complex AI decisions.
- **Pattern:**
    - Provide a link or button to open a dedicated explanation panel.
    - The explanation panel should provide a detailed breakdown of the factors that influenced the decision, including any relevant data or charts.

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Keyboard Accessibility:** Ensure that all explanation interfaces are fully accessible via keyboard.
- **Screen Readers:** Use ARIA attributes to ensure that screen readers can identify and announce the content of the explanation interfaces.
