# Feedback Mechanisms for AI Accuracy

This document outlines the design patterns for collecting user feedback on the accuracy of AI-generated suggestions and predictions.

## Rationale

User feedback is essential for improving the accuracy and relevance of our AI models. These patterns are designed to make it easy for users to provide feedback without disrupting their workflow.

## Core Components

- **Thumbs Up/Down Buttons:** For quick binary feedback.
- **Rating Scales:** For more granular feedback.
- **Open-Ended Text Fields:** For detailed qualitative feedback.

## Patterns

### 1. Thumbs Up/Down Buttons

- **Use Case:** For quick feedback on the relevance of an AI suggestion.
- **Pattern:**
    - Display thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons next to the AI suggestion.
    - Clicking an icon records the feedback and provides a visual confirmation (e.g., the icon becomes filled).

### 2. Rating Scales

- **Use Case:** For more granular feedback on the quality of an AI suggestion.
- **Pattern:**
    - Display a star rating or a numerical scale (e.g., 1-5) next to the AI suggestion.
    - Allow users to select a rating to provide their feedback.

### 3. Open-Ended Text Fields

- **Use Case:** For detailed feedback on why a suggestion was helpful or unhelpful.
- **Pattern:**
    - Provide a link or button to open a modal with a text field for detailed feedback.
    - Keep the feedback form simple and focused on the specific suggestion.

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Keyboard Accessibility:** Ensure that all feedback mechanisms are fully accessible via keyboard.
- **Screen Readers:** Use ARIA attributes to ensure that screen readers can identify and announce the purpose of each feedback mechanism.
