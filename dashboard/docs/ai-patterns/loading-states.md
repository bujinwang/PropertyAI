# Loading and Processing State Visualizations

This document outlines the design patterns for visualizing loading and processing states for AI operations.

## Rationale

It is important to provide users with clear feedback when the system is performing a long-running operation. This helps to manage user expectations and to prevent them from thinking that the application has frozen.

## Core Components

- **Loading Spinners:** For indeterminate loading states.
- **Progress Bars:** For determinate loading states.
- **Animated Icons:** For providing more context about the operation in progress.

## Patterns

### 1. Loading Spinners

- **Use Case:** When the duration of an operation is unknown.
- **Pattern:**
    - Display a loading spinner in the center of the content area that is being loaded.
    - Use a consistent loading spinner across the platform.

### 2. Progress Bars

- **Use Case:** When the duration of an operation can be estimated.
- **Pattern:**
    - Display a progress bar to indicate the progress of the operation.
    - Provide an estimated time remaining when possible.

### 3. Animated Icons

- **Use Case:** For providing more context about the operation in progress.
- **Pattern:**
    - Use an animated icon that is relevant to the operation being performed (e.g., a magnifying glass for a search operation).
    - Use subtle animations to avoid distracting the user.

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Screen Readers:** Use ARIA attributes to ensure that screen readers can identify and announce that an operation is in progress.
- **Reduced Motion:** Provide an option to reduce motion for users who are sensitive to animations.
