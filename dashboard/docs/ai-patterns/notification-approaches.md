# Notification Approaches for Proactive AI Insights

This document outlines the design patterns for delivering proactive AI insights to users in a relevant, timely, and non-intrusive manner.

## Rationale

Proactive AI insights can provide significant value to users, but they must be delivered in a way that is not disruptive to their workflow. These patterns are designed to provide users with the right information at the right time, without overwhelming them with notifications.

## Core Components

- **Banners:** For high-priority, contextual insights.
- **Badges:** For low-priority, non-intrusive notifications.
- **In-App Messages:** For more detailed insights that require user action.

## Patterns

### 1. Banners

- **Use Case:** For high-priority insights that require immediate attention.
- **Pattern:**
    - Display a banner at the top of the screen with a concise summary of the insight.
    - Use a color-coded system to indicate the urgency of the insight (e.g., red for critical, yellow for warning).
    - Provide a link to a more detailed view of the insight.

### 2. Badges

- **Use Case:** For low-priority insights that do not require immediate action.
- **Pattern:**
    - Display a badge on the relevant UI element (e.g., a navigation link, a list item).
    - The badge should indicate the number of new insights available.
    - Clicking the UI element should take the user to a view where they can see the insights.

### 3. In-App Messages

- **Use Case:** For more detailed insights that require user action.
- **Pattern:**
    - Display an in-app message with a detailed explanation of the insight and a clear call to action.
    - Use a modal or a dedicated panel to display the in-app message.

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Color Contrast:** Ensure that the colors used for notifications have sufficient contrast to be accessible to users with visual impairments.
- **Screen Readers:** Use ARIA attributes to ensure that screen readers can identify and announce the content of the notifications.
