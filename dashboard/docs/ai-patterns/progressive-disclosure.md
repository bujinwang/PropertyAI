# Progressive Disclosure Patterns for AI Capabilities

This document outlines the design patterns for progressively disclosing complex AI capabilities to users.

## Rationale

It is important to avoid overwhelming users with too much information at once. Progressive disclosure allows us to introduce new features and capabilities in a gradual and contextual manner, which helps to improve learnability and to reduce cognitive load.

## Core Components

- **Tooltips:** For brief, contextual explanations.
- **Tutorials:** For guided walkthroughs of new features.
- **Documentation:** For comprehensive information about advanced features.

## Patterns

### 1. Tooltips

- **Use Case:** For providing brief, contextual explanations of AI features.
- **Pattern:**
    - Display a tooltip when the user hovers over an AI-powered feature.
    - The tooltip should provide a concise explanation of the feature and its benefits.

### 2. Tutorials

- **Use Case:** For providing guided walkthroughs of new or complex AI features.
- **Pattern:**
    - Provide a link or button to launch an interactive tutorial.
    - The tutorial should guide the user through the steps of using the feature, with clear instructions and visual cues.

### 3. Documentation

- **Use Case:** For providing comprehensive information about advanced AI features.
- **Pattern:**
    - Provide a link to the relevant section of the documentation.
    - The documentation should provide a detailed explanation of the feature, including its capabilities, limitations, and best practices.

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Keyboard Accessibility:** Ensure that all progressive disclosure mechanisms are fully accessible via keyboard.
- **Screen Readers:** Use ARIA attributes to ensure that screen readers can identify and announce the content of the progressive disclosure mechanisms.
