# AI Communication Training Screen: Wireframes & User Flow

This document outlines the wireframes and user flow for the AI Communication Training Screen in the PropertyFlow AI application. The screen is designed to give property managers control over how the AI communicates with tenants and other contacts.

## 1. Screen Layout

The screen will be a single, comprehensive dashboard organized into several key sections using `Card` components for clarity and separation of concerns.

- **Component:** `AICommunicationTrainingScreen.tsx`
- **Navigation:** Accessible from the main settings or AI management area.

## 2. Automated Response Settings

**Objective:** Configure the rules and triggers for automated AI responses.

**Wireframe:**
- **Title:** "Automated Response Settings"
- **Components:**
    - **Response Triggers:** A multi-select dropdown or checklist to define when the AI should respond automatically (e.g., "After Hours," "Common Questions," "Maintenance Requests").
    - **Response Delay:** A slider or input field to set a delay (in minutes or hours) before an automated response is sent.
    - **Escalation Rules:** A section to define when a conversation should be escalated to a human agent (e.g., "After 2 AI responses," "If sentiment is negative").

## 3. Example Scenarios & Suggested Responses

**Objective:** Provide a training ground for the AI by allowing managers to review, edit, and approve AI-generated responses.

**Wireframe:**
- **Title:** "Review & Train AI Responses"
- **Layout:** A list of expandable cards, each representing a common scenario (e.g., "Rent Payment Reminder," "Lease Renewal Inquiry").
- **Card Content:**
    - **Scenario:** A brief description of the situation.
    - **AI-Suggested Response:** A text area displaying the AI's proposed response, with clear visual cues (e.g., a colored border, an "AI" icon) to indicate it's AI-generated.
    - **Actions:**
        - **"Approve"**: Accepts the suggestion.
        - **"Edit & Approve"**: Allows the manager to modify the response before approving.
        - **"Reject"**: Discards the suggestion and prompts the AI to generate a new one.

## 4. Tone & Style Configuration

**Objective:** Customize the personality and voice of the AI.

**Wireframe:**
- **Title:** "Communication Tone & Style"
- **Components:**
    - **Tone:** A set of radio buttons or a slider to choose between tones like "Formal," "Friendly," and "Casual."
    - **Style:** A similar control for styles like "Concise," "Detailed," and "Empathetic."
    - **Visual Indicators:** Each option will have a brief description and perhaps an example snippet to illustrate the effect.

## 5. Approval Workflow for New Templates

**Objective:** Ensure quality control for new, AI-generated response templates.

**Wireframe:**
- **Title:** "Template Approval Queue"
- **Layout:** A list of pending templates awaiting review.
- **List Item Content:**
    - Template name and the scenario it addresses.
    - A "Review" button that opens a modal with the full template and approval/rejection options.
- **Permissions:** This section will only be visible to users with the "Approver" role.

## 6. Real-time Preview

**Objective:** Provide immediate feedback on how the configured settings will affect AI responses.

**Wireframe:**
- **Title:** "Live Preview"
- **Layout:** A mock chat interface.
- **Functionality:** As the user adjusts settings in the "Tone & Style" or "Automated Response" sections, the preview will update to show how the AI would respond to a sample message.

## 7. Learning Feedback Loop

- **Implicit Feedback:** The system will track which AI suggestions are approved, edited, or rejected, and use this data to improve future recommendations.
- **Explicit Feedback:** A simple "Was this suggestion helpful?" (thumbs up/down) could be added to each AI-suggested response to gather more direct feedback.
