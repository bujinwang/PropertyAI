# AI Risk Assessment Dashboard: Wireframes & User Flow

This document outlines the wireframes and user flow for the AI Risk Assessment Dashboard in the PropertyFlow AI application. The dashboard is designed to provide property managers with a clear, compliant, and intuitive way to assess applicant risk.

## 1. Dashboard View

**Objective:** Provide a high-level overview of applicant risk profiles.

**Wireframe:**
- **Title:** "Applicant Risk Assessment"
- **Components:**
    - A summary section with key metrics (e.g., "Total Applicants," "High-Risk," "Low-Risk").
    - A list or card view of recent applicants, each with a color-coded risk indicator (e.g., green, yellow, red) and a summary risk score.
- **Actions:**
    - Clicking on an applicant opens the detailed "Risk Factor Breakdown" view.
    - A button to initiate a "Comparative Analysis."

## 2. Applicant Comparison View

**Objective:** Allow for side-by-side comparison of multiple applicants.

**Wireframe:**
- **Title:** "Compare Applicants"
- **Layout:** A multi-column layout where each column represents an applicant.
- **Content:**
    - Key risk factors (e.g., "Credit Score," "Income-to-Rent Ratio," "Rental History") are listed as rows.
    - Each cell displays the applicant's data for that factor, with color-coding to indicate risk.
- **Action:** A "View Detailed Report" button for each applicant, linking to their full risk breakdown.

## 3. Risk Factor Breakdown

**Objective:** Provide a transparent and detailed explanation of an individual applicant's risk score.

**Wireframe:**
- **Title:** "Risk Assessment for [Applicant Name]"
- **Components:**
    - **Overall Risk Score:** Displayed prominently at the top.
    - **Risk Factor List:** A list of all factors contributing to the score. Each factor includes:
        - The factor name (e.g., "Payment History").
        - The applicant's data for that factor.
        - A visual indicator of the factor's impact on the score.
        - A "Learn More" link that opens a modal with a detailed explanation of the factor and its relevance, including fair housing compliance notes.
- **AI Explanation:** A dedicated section explaining that the score is AI-generated and intended as a recommendation, not a final decision.

## 4. Decision Override Interface

**Objective:** Enable property managers to override the AI's recommendation with proper justification.

**Wireframe:**
- **Trigger:** A button on the "Risk Factor Breakdown" screen, labeled "Override Recommendation."
- **Modal/Form:**
    - **Title:** "Override AI Recommendation for [Applicant Name]"
    - **Fields:**
        - A dropdown to select the new decision (e.g., "Approve," "Deny").
        - A mandatory text area for "Justification."
    - **Action:** A "Submit Override" button that records the decision and justification.

## 5. Data Visualization

- **Charts/Graphs:** Use simple bar charts or radial graphs to visualize the weight of different risk categories (e.g., "Financial," "Rental History," "Employment").
- **Color-Coding:** Consistently use a green-yellow-red color scheme to indicate low, medium, and high risk, respectively. Ensure colors are accessible.

## 6. Compliance and Accessibility

- **Fair Housing Disclaimers:** Include clear disclaimers throughout the interface stating that all decisions must comply with fair housing laws.
- **Accessibility:** Use clear, high-contrast text, provide alt text for all visual elements, and ensure the entire interface is navigable via keyboard.
