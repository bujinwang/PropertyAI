# UI Design Handoff Documentation

This document provides the necessary information for the development team to implement the UI designs for the PropertyFlow AI platform.

## 1. Asset Specifications

- **Icons:** All icons should be exported as SVG files to ensure scalability and maintain a small file size.
- **Images:** All images should be optimized for the web and exported in the appropriate format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, WebP).
- **Naming Conventions:** All assets should follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., `icon-name.svg`, `image-purpose.jpg`).

## 2. Component Specifications

- **Dimensions and Spacing:** All dimensions and spacing should be based on the 8px grid system defined in the design system.
- **Colors:** All colors should be referenced from the color palette defined in `dashboard/src/design-system/theme.ts`.
- **Typography:** All text styles should be referenced from the typography system defined in `dashboard/src/design-system/theme.ts`.

## 3. Interactive States

- **Hover:** All interactive elements should have a clear hover state (e.g., a change in background color or a subtle shadow).
- **Active:** All interactive elements should have a clear active state (e.g., a change in background color or a border).
- **Disabled:** All interactive elements should have a clear disabled state (e.g., a grayed-out appearance and a "not-allowed" cursor).
- **Focus:** All interactive elements should have a clear focus state (e.g., a visible outline) to ensure keyboard accessibility.

## 4. Responsive Behavior

- **Breakpoints:** The responsive breakpoints are defined in `dashboard/src/design-system/layout.ts`.
- **Layout Adaptations:** The layout should adapt to different screen sizes as follows:
    - **Mobile:** A single-column layout with a focus on vertical scrolling.
    - **Tablet:** A two-column layout with a sidebar for navigation.
    - **Desktop:** A multi-column layout with a sidebar and a main content area.

## 5. Animation and Transitions

- **Timing:** All animations and transitions should have a duration of 200-300ms.
- **Easing:** Use the `ease-in-out` timing function for all animations and transitions.
- **Subtlety:** Animations should be subtle and used to enhance the user experience, not to distract from the content.

## 6. Accessibility

- **Color Contrast:** All text should have a minimum color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against its background.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements should be accessible via keyboard.
- **Screen Readers:** All images should have descriptive alt text, and all form inputs should have associated labels.

## 7. CSS Variables/Style Tokens

- The design system is based on Material-UI, which uses a theme object to manage styles. The theme is defined in `dashboard/src/design-system/theme.ts`.

## 8. Implementation Notes

- **AI-Specific Components:** The AI-specific components should be implemented as reusable React components and documented in Storybook.
- **Data Flow:** The data flow for each screen should be clearly defined, with a focus on how data is passed to and from the AI services.
- **Edge Cases:** All edge cases (e.g., empty states, error states) should be handled gracefully.
