# Material-UI Best Practices for PropertyAI Dashboard

This document outlines key aspects and best practices for utilizing Material-UI (MUI) within the PropertyAI dashboard to ensure consistency, maintainability, and optimal performance.

## 1. Theming and Customization

Material-UI's theming system is powerful for maintaining a consistent design language.

*   **Centralized Theme:** All global styles, colors, typography, and spacing should be defined in `dashboard/src/design-system/theme.ts`. Avoid hardcoding values directly in components.
*   **`ThemeProvider`:** Ensure the `ThemeProvider` wraps the entire application to make the theme accessible to all MUI components.
*   **Customizing Components:**
    *   **`sx` Prop:** For one-off style overrides or responsive adjustments, use the `sx` prop directly on MUI components. This is the most flexible and recommended approach for inline styling.
    *   **`styled` API:** For creating reusable, styled components that extend MUI components or HTML elements, use the `styled` utility from `@mui/material/styles`. This is ideal for creating custom variants or complex component compositions.
    *   **`createTheme`:** When extending or overriding default MUI component styles globally, use `createTheme` and its `components` property within your theme definition.

```typescript
// Example: dashboard/src/design-system/theme.ts
import { createTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';

const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#1976d2', // PropertyAI primary color
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#dc004e',
    },
  },
  typography: {
    fontFamily: 'Roboto, sans-serif',
    h4: {
      fontWeight: 600,
    },
  },
  components: {
    MuiButton: {
      styleOverrides: {
        root: {
          borderRadius: 8,
        },
      },
    },
  },
});

export default theme;
```

## 2. Component Usage

*   **Leverage Built-in Components:** Prioritize using Material-UI's extensive set of pre-built components. This ensures consistency, accessibility, and reduces development time.
*   **Semantic HTML:** Use the appropriate MUI component for the semantic meaning (e.g., `Button` for buttons, `Typography` for text, `Link` for navigation).
*   **Composition:** Combine smaller MUI components to build more complex UI elements.
*   **Avoid Direct DOM Manipulation:** Rely on React's state and props for UI updates rather than directly manipulating the DOM.

## 3. Accessibility (A11y)

Material-UI components are designed with accessibility in mind, but proper usage is crucial.

*   **Semantic Elements:** Use `Button`, `Link`, `Input`, etc., as intended.
*   **Labels and Descriptions:** Ensure all form inputs have associated labels (e.g., using `InputLabel` with `TextField`). Provide descriptive `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attributes for interactive elements where visual labels are not present.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Test all interactive elements for keyboard navigability (Tab, Enter, Space keys).
*   **Color Contrast:** Adhere to WCAG guidelines for color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text). The theme palette should be designed with this in mind.
*   **Focus Management:** Ensure focus is managed correctly, especially for modals, dialogs, and dynamic content updates.

## 4. Performance Considerations

*   **Code Splitting:** Use React's `lazy` and `Suspense` for code-splitting large components or pages to reduce initial bundle size and improve load times. (e.g., see `dashboard/src/design-system/components/ai/lazy.ts`).
*   **Memoization:** Utilize `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components, especially for complex or frequently updated UI elements.
*   **Virtualization:** For long lists or tables, consider using libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized` in conjunction with MUI components to render only visible items, improving performance.
*   **Optimize Images:** Ensure all images are optimized for web delivery (compressed, appropriate format, responsive sizes).

## 5. Folder Structure and Reusability

*   **`dashboard/src/components`:** This directory should house all reusable UI components, categorized logically (e.g., `shared`, `ai`, `financial`).
*   **`dashboard/src/design-system`:** This directory is dedicated to the core design system elements, including:
    *   `theme.ts`: Centralized theme definition.
    *   `layout.ts`: Breakpoints and layout-related constants.
    *   `components/`: Wrapper components or custom styled components that extend MUI.
*   **Storybook:** Document all reusable components in Storybook to facilitate development, testing, and design handoff.

By following these best practices, the PropertyAI dashboard can leverage Material-UI effectively to build a robust, scalable, and user-friendly interface.
