# Usability Testing Plan: AI-Powered UI Mockups

This document outlines the plan for conducting usability testing on the UI mockups for the new AI-powered screens in the PropertyFlow AI application.

## 1. Objectives

- To evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the AI-powered features and UI mockups.
- To identify any usability issues, pain points, or areas for design improvement.
- To gather feedback on the clarity, intuitiveness, and overall user experience of the new screens.
- To assess user understanding and comfort level with AI-generated content and suggestions.

## 2. Methodology

- **Moderated, In-Person & Remote Sessions:** A combination of in-person and remote moderated sessions will be conducted to accommodate a wider range of participants.
- **Think-Aloud Protocol:** Participants will be encouraged to "think aloud" as they interact with the prototypes, verbalizing their thoughts, actions, and feelings.
- **Task-Based Scenarios:** Participants will be given a set of realistic task scenarios to complete using the interactive prototypes.

## 3. Participant Recruitment

- **Roles:** Recruit a mix of participants representing both **property managers** and **tenants**.
- **Experience Level:** Include participants with varying levels of technical proficiency, from novice to expert.
- **Sample Size:** Aim for 5-7 participants per role to identify the most significant usability issues.

## 4. Task Scenarios

### For Property Managers:

- **Scenario 1: AI-Guided Setup**
  - **Task:** Use the AI-Guided Setup Wizard to configure a new property.
- **Scenario 2: Risk Assessment**
  - **Task:** Review the AI Risk Assessment Dashboard to identify high-risk tenants or properties.
- **Scenario 3: Emergency Response**
  - **Task:** Use the Emergency Response Center to manage a simulated emergency situation.

### For Tenants:

- **Scenario 4: Personalized Recommendations**
  - **Task:** Interact with the AI Personalization Dashboard to discover personalized recommendations for local services.
- **Scenario 5: Communication Training**
  - **Task:** Use the AI Communication Training Screen to practice communication with property management.

## 5. Data Collection

- **Qualitative Data:**
  - Observer notes from the moderated sessions.
  - Recordings of the sessions (with participant consent).
  - User quotes and direct feedback.
- **Quantitative Data:**
  - Task completion rates.
  - Time on task.
  - Error rates.
  - Post-session surveys (e.g., System Usability Scale - SUS).

## 6. Analysis and Reporting

- **Analysis:** The collected data will be analyzed to identify recurring themes, usability issues, and areas for improvement.
- **Reporting:** A comprehensive report will be prepared, summarizing the findings and providing actionable recommendations for the design and development teams.

## 7. Interactive Prototypes

- The following screens should be converted into interactive prototypes for the testing sessions:
  - AI-Guided Setup Wizard
  - AI Risk Assessment Dashboard
  - AI Communication Training Screen
  - Emergency Response Center Screen
  - Data Privacy & Compliance Center Screen
  - Security Settings Dashboard
