# Responsive Design Strategy

This document outlines the responsive design strategy for the PropertyFlow AI web dashboard.

## Guiding Principles

- **Mobile-First:** Design for mobile devices first, then scale up to larger screens.
- **Fluid Grids:** Use a fluid grid system to ensure content reflows gracefully across different screen sizes.
- **Flexible Images:** Use flexible images that scale with the grid.
- **Media Queries:** Use media queries to apply different styles for different screen sizes.

## Breakpoints

The following breakpoints will be used to target different screen sizes:

- **Mobile:** < 768px
- **Tablet:** 768px - 1024px
- **Desktop:** > 1024px

## Grid System

A 12-column fluid grid system will be used to lay out content. The number of columns will be adjusted based on the screen size.

## Typography

A responsive typography system will be used to ensure text is readable on all devices. Font sizes will be adjusted based on the screen size.

## Navigation

A responsive navigation system will be used to ensure navigation is easy to use on all devices. A hamburger menu will be used on mobile devices to save space.

## UI Components

All UI components will be designed to be responsive and work well on all devices.
