- **Supply & Demand Analysis**: Combined line chart showing market balance indicators
- **Trend Summary Cards**: Visual indicators with trend icons and percentage changes
- **Interactive Timeframe Selection**: Dropdown to filter data by 1/3/6/12 months
- **AI Confidence Indicator**: Shows analysis confidence with explanation tooltip

**Chart Types**:
- Line charts for rent trends and supply/demand
- Bar charts for vacancy rates
- Color-coded indicators based on performance thresholds

#### 2. CompetitorAnalysisMap Component
**File**: `dashboard/src/components/market-intelligence/CompetitorAnalysisMap.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Interactive Map Visualization**: Simulated map with competitor property markers
- **Property Markers**: Color-coded by occupancy rate (green/orange/red)
- **Marker Sizing**: Size indicates market share percentage
- **Filtering Options**: Filter by occupancy, rent range (premium/budget)

- **Detailed Property Information**: Click markers for detailed competitor data
- **Legend**: Clear explanation of marker colors and sizing

**Interactive Elements**:
- Hover tooltips showing basic property info
- Click-to-open detailed property modal
- Filter dropdown for different property types
- Map navigation controls

#### 3. DemandForecastCharts Component
**File**: `dashboard/src/components/market-intelligence/DemandForecastCharts.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Demand Prediction Chart**: Line chart with confidence bands (upper/lower bounds)
- **Confidence Visualization**: Bar chart showing prediction reliability by period
- **Trend Analysis**: Summary cards showing overall trend direction
- **Contributing Factors**: Expandable accordion showing forecast factors with impact weights
- **Reliability Alerts**: Color-coded alerts based on confidence levels
- **Methodology Explanation**: Tooltip explaining AI forecasting approach

**Advanced Features**:
- Confidence bands calculated from prediction uncertainty
- Factor impact visualization with positive/negative indicators
- Seasonal adjustment indicators
- Time-series forecasting with multiple data points

### Enhanced MarketIntelligenceScreen
**File**: `dashboard/src/pages/MarketIntelligenceScreen.tsx`

**Improvements**:
- Integrated all new components into cohesive dashboard layout
- Added proper data fetching for trends and forecasts
- Responsive grid layout with proper component spacing
- Loading states and error handling for all components
- Coordinated component interactions and data flow

### Service Layer Updates
**File**: `dashboard/src/services/marketIntelligenceService.ts`

**New Methods**:
- `fetchMarketTrends()`: Retrieves market trend data
- `fetchDemandForecasts()`: Gets demand prediction data
- Mock data generators for development and testing
- Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Chart.js Integration
- Registered required Chart.js components (CategoryScale, LinearScale, etc.)
- Custom chart options for responsive design
- Color-coded data visualization based on performance metrics
- Interactive tooltips with additional context information

#### Material-UI Components
- Used Grid2 for responsive layout (compatible with MUI v7)
- Consistent card-based design pattern
- Proper theme integration with color schemes
- Accessible form controls and interactive elements

#### AI Integration Patterns
- AIGeneratedContent wrapper for AI-powered components
- ConfidenceIndicator integration throughout
- ExplanationTooltip for methodology transparency
- Consistent feedback collection mechanisms

### Data Models
Enhanced type definitions in `dashboard/src/types/market-intelligence.ts`:
- `MarketTrend`: Trend data with categories and change indicators
- `DemandForecast`: Prediction data with confidence scores and factors
- `ForecastFactor`: Individual contributing factors with weights
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

### Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Requirement 8.1**: Charts for rent prices, vacancy rates, and market trends using Chart.js
