# PropertyFlow AI Design System

This document outlines the design system and UI component library for the PropertyFlow AI platform. The goal is to ensure a consistent, accessible, and high-quality user experience across all applications.

## 1. Core Principles

- **Clarity:** The UI should be clean, intuitive, and easy to understand.
- **Consistency:** Components and patterns should be applied consistently across the platform.
- **Efficiency:** The design should enable users to accomplish tasks quickly and with minimal effort.
- **Accessibility:** The platform must be usable by people with a wide range of abilities.

## 2. Style Guide

### 2.1. Typography

The typography system will be defined in `theme.ts` and will include styles for:
- Headings (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)
- Body text
- Subtitles and captions

### 2.2. Color Palette

The color palette will be defined in `theme.ts` and will include:
- **Primary Colors:** For main UI elements and branding.
- **Secondary Colors:** For accents and secondary actions.
- **Semantic Colors:** For success, warning, error, and info states.
- **Neutral Colors:** For text, backgrounds, and borders.

### 2.3. Spacing & Layout

- A consistent spacing scale (e.g., based on an 8px grid) will be used for margins, padding, and layout composition.
- Responsive breakpoints will be defined to ensure a seamless experience across devices.

## 3. Component Library

    - `Heatmap`

## 4. Documentation

- **Storybook:** We will use Storybook to create interactive documentation for each component, showcasing its different states and variants.
- **Figma:** The master design files, including all components and styles, will be maintained in Figma.
