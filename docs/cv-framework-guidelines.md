# Computer Vision Model Development & Deployment Framework

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the framework for developing, deploying, and managing Computer Vision (CV) models at PropertyAI. The goal is to establish a robust, scalable, and standardized process that ensures high-quality models, ethical AI practices, and efficient MLOps.

## 2. Governance Policies

### 2.1. Ethical AI Principles

All CV models must be developed and deployed in accordance with the following ethical principles:

- **Fairness:** Models should not exhibit bias against any protected group.
- **Transparency:** Model decisions should be explainable and understandable.
- **Accountability:** There should be clear ownership and responsibility for model outcomes.
- **Privacy:** All data handling must comply with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).

### 2.2. Data Governance

- **Data Sourcing:** All data used for training and evaluation must be ethically sourced and have clear ownership.
- **Data Security:** All data must be stored securely, with access controls in place.
- **Data Privacy:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII) must be redacted or anonymized where possible.

### 2.3. Model Governance

- **Model Versioning:** All models must be versioned, with clear documentation of changes between versions.
- **Model Lifecycle Management:** All models must have a defined lifecycle, including development, deployment, monitoring, and retirement.
- **Model Risk Management:** All models must undergo a risk assessment to identify and mitigate potential risks.

## 3. Framework Requirements

### 3.1. Development Environment

- **Standardized Development Environment:** A standardized development environment will be provided to ensure consistency and reproducibility.
- **Experiment Tracking:** All experiments must be tracked using a tool like MLflow or Weights & Biases.
- **Code Versioning:** All code must be versioned using Git.

### 3.2. MLOps Toolchain

- **Containerization:** All models must be containerized using Docker. This ensures that the model and its dependencies are packaged together, providing a consistent environment for development, testing, and deployment.
- **Orchestration:** All pipelines must be orchestrated using a tool like Luigi, Kubeflow, or Airflow. This allows for the automation of complex workflows, including data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **CI/CD:** All models must be deployed using a CI/CD pipeline. This enables the automated testing and deployment of models, reducing the risk of manual errors and ensuring that models are deployed to production in a consistent and reliable manner.

## 3.3. Training Pipelines

- **Data Ingestion:** The first step in the training pipeline is to ingest data from the source. This may involve downloading data from a remote source, extracting it from a database, or performing some other data ingestion task.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Once the data has been ingested, it must be preprocessed to prepare it for model training. This may include operations like resizing images, augmenting data, and splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Model Training:** After the data has been preprocessed, the model can be trained. This involves using a machine learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to train a model on the preprocessed data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Once the model has been trained, it must be evaluated to assess its performance. This involves using the trained model to make predictions on a test set and computing evaluation metrics.

## 3.4. Deployment Infrastructure

- **Model Registry:** All trained models must be stored in a model registry. This allows for the versioning and management of models, and makes it easy to deploy different versions of a model to production.
- **Model Serving:** All models must be deployed as a service, such as a REST API endpoint. This allows other services to easily consume the model's predictions.
- **Monitoring:** All deployed models must be monitored to ensure that they are performing as expected. This includes monitoring for model accuracy, data drift, concept drift, latency, error rates, and resource utilization.

## 4. Quality Standards

### 4.1. Model Performance

- **Performance Metrics:** All models must be evaluated using a standard set of performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mAP).
- **Performance Thresholds:** All models must meet a minimum performance threshold before being deployed to production.

### 4.2. Model Validation

- **Cross-Validation:** All models must be validated using cross-validation techniques.
- **Hold-out Test Sets:** All models must be evaluated on a hold-out test set that is representative of the production environment.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

- **AI Lead:** Responsible for overseeing the development and deployment of all CV models.
- **Data Scientist:** Responsible for developing and training CV models.
- **MLOps Engineer:** Responsible for deploying and managing CV models in production.
- **Data Governance Team:** Responsible for ensuring compliance with data governance policies.
- **Legal/Compliance Team:** Responsible for ensuring compliance with ethical AI principles and legal regulations.
