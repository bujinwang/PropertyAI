# Database Optimization Plan

This document outlines the strategy for optimizing the platform's database performance. The plan is divided into several phases, each targeting a specific area of improvement.

## Phase 1: Slow Query Analysis (Task 128.13)

**Objective:** Identify and analyze slow-running queries that are impacting application performance.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Enable `pg_stat_statements`:**
    *   Connect to the PostgreSQL instance and ensure the `pg_stat_statements` extension is enabled.
    *   If not enabled, run `CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;`.
    *   Configure `postgresql.conf` to preload the extension: `shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'`.
    *   Restart the PostgreSQL server for the changes to take effect.

2.  **Gather Query Statistics:**
    *   Allow the application to run under a normal load for a sufficient period to gather meaningful query statistics.
    *   Periodically query the `pg_stat_statements` view to identify the top queries by `total_time`, `mean_time`, and `calls`.

3.  **Analyze Slow Queries:**
    *   For each identified slow query, use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to understand the query execution plan.
    *   Look for performance bottlenecks such as sequential scans on large tables, nested loops, and inefficient joins.

4.  **Optimize Queries:**
    *   Based on the analysis, optimize the queries by:
        *   Adding appropriate indexes.
        *   Rewriting queries to be more efficient.
        *   Denormalizing data where appropriate.

## Phase 2: Schema and Index Review (Task 128.14)

**Objective:** Review the database schema and indexing strategy to ensure they are optimized for current query patterns.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Index Review:**
    *   Identify missing indexes on frequently queried columns, especially foreign key columns and columns used in `WHERE` clauses.
    *   Analyze existing indexes to identify unused or redundant indexes that can be removed.
    *   Consider using partial indexes for large tables with specific query patterns.

2.  **Schema Normalization and Denormalization:**
    *   Review the schema for normalization issues that could lead to data anomalies.
    *   Identify opportunities for denormalization to improve query performance, especially for read-heavy workloads.

3.  **Table Bloat Analysis:**
    *   Use PostgreSQL's built-in tools to check for table and index bloat.
    *   If significant bloat is found, run `VACUUM FULL` or use `pg_repack` to reclaim disk space and improve performance.

## Phase 3: PostgreSQL Configuration Tuning (Task 128.15)

**Objective:** Tune PostgreSQL configuration parameters to optimize performance for the specific hardware and workload.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Analyze Current Configuration:**
    *   Review the current `postgresql.conf` file to understand the existing configuration.

2.  **Tune Key Parameters:**
    *   **`shared_buffers`:** Adjust based on the available RAM. A common starting point is 25% of the total system memory.
    *   **`work_mem`:** Increase to allow more memory for sorting and hashing operations, which can improve the performance of complex queries.
    *   **`maintenance_work_mem`:** Increase to speed up maintenance tasks like `VACUUM` and `CREATE INDEX`.
    *   **`effective_cache_size`:** Set to approximately 50-75% of the total system memory to give the query planner a better estimate of the available cache.

3.  **Monitor Performance:**
    *   After making configuration changes, monitor the system's performance to ensure the changes have a positive impact.

## Phase 4: Table Partitioning (Task 128.16)

**Objective:** Evaluate and implement table partitioning for large tables to improve query performance and manageability.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Identify Candidate Tables:**
    *   Identify large tables that are frequently queried by a specific key, such as a date range. The `MaintenanceRequest`, `Message`, and `Transaction` tables are strong candidates.

2.  **Choose a Partitioning Strategy:**
    *   Based on the query patterns, choose a partitioning strategy (e.g., range, list, or hash). Range partitioning by a date column is a common choice.

3.  **Implement Partitioning:**
    *   Create a partitioned table and migrate the data from the original table.
    *   Update the application to query the partitioned table.

## Phase 5: Connection Pooling (Task 128.17)

**Objective:** Review and optimize connection pooling to ensure efficient use of database connections.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Review Current Setup:**
    *   Investigate how connection pooling is currently handled. By default, Prisma creates a connection pool. Check the Prisma client configuration for any custom settings.
    *   If a separate connection pooler like PgBouncer is in use, review its configuration.

2.  **Optimize Connection Pool Settings:**
    *   Adjust the connection pool size based on the application's needs and the database server's capacity.
    *   Configure connection timeout and idle connection settings to prevent resource leaks.

## Phase 6: Documentation and Future Actions (Tasks 128.18, 128.19)

**Objective:** Document all optimization changes and propose further architectural actions if needed.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Documentation:**
    *   Maintain a detailed record of all changes made, including the rationale for each change and its impact on performance.

2.  **Future Actions:**
    *   Based on the findings of the optimization process, propose further architectural actions, such as:
        *   **Read Replicas:** For read-heavy workloads, consider setting up read replicas to distribute the load.
        *   **Sharding:** For very large databases, consider sharding to distribute the data across multiple servers.
