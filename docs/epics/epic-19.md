# Epic 19: Payment Integration

## Epic Goal

Enable seamless rent collection and payment processing within the PropertyAI platform to streamline landlord-tenant financial transactions, reduce manual invoicing, and improve cash flow management for property owners.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context
- Current financial tracking: Basic rent due dates and amounts in Unit/Tenant models, but no payment processing.
- Technology stack: Express.js backend with Sequelize ORM; React frontend with MUI; existing auth and notification services.
- Integration points: Extend Tenant model for payment methods; add routes/services for Stripe webhooks; update Dashboard for payment history/status.

### Enhancement Details
- Integrate Stripe for secure card payments, ACH transfers, and recurring billing.
- Support one-time rent payments and auto-recurring setups.
- Generate invoices, track payment status (pending, paid, failed), and send notifications.
- Ensure compliance with PCI DSS via Stripe; handle failures/refunds.
- Success criteria: 99% uptime for payments, <2s processing time, full audit logs.

## Stories

1. **Story 19.1: Stripe Integration and Payment Setup**  
   Implement Stripe SDK, add payment methods to Tenant model, create /payment/setup route for saving cards/ACH.

2. **Story 19.2: Rent Payment Processing and Invoicing**  
   Add invoice generation, /payment/process route for one-time/recurring payments, update payment status in real-time.

3. **Story 19.3: Payment Dashboard and Notifications**  
   Extend Dashboard with payment history tab, integrate notifications for due/overdue/paid, handle webhooks for status updates.

## Compatibility Requirements
- Existing rent tracking unchanged; payments additive.
- Backward compatible DB schema (new JSON fields for Stripe IDs).
- UI follows MUI patterns; no breaking changes to auth/notifications.
- Performance: <5s end-to-end payment flow.

## Risk Mitigation
- **Primary Risk:** Payment failures disrupting tenant relations.  
  **Mitigation:** Comprehensive error handling, retries, manual fallback; test with Stripe test cards.  
  **Rollback Plan:** Disable new payment routes, revert to manual tracking.

- **Secondary Risk:** Compliance/PCI issues.  
  **Mitigation:** Use Stripe's managed compliance; add consent checks and data encryption.

## Definition of Done
- All stories completed with acceptance criteria met.
- Existing functionality (matching/screening) verified through testing.
- Integration points (Stripe webhooks, notifications) working correctly.
- End-to-end payment flow tested with mocks/real sandbox.
- Documentation updated (API docs, setup guide).
- No regression in core features; load tests pass.
