# Epic 20: Advanced Reporting

## Epic Goal

Build comprehensive analytics capabilities for PropertyAI to provide property owners and managers with actionable insights into performance, tenant metrics, and financial health. This epic enables data-driven decision-making through customizable dashboards and export features.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Builds on Epics 17 (basic analytics), 18 (matching/screening data), 19 (payment/financial data).
- Integrates with existing Tenant, Property, Invoice, Payment models.
- Uses current dashboard structure (MUI Tabs/DataGrid) for consistency.
- Leverages backend services (tenantService, paymentService) for data aggregation.

**Enhancement Details:**
- Customizable dashboards for key metrics (occupancy rates, revenue trends, tenant retention).
- Interactive visualizations (charts, filters) for property performance.
- Export reports (PDF/CSV) for financial summaries and compliance.
- Role-based access (owners see portfolio, managers see property-specific).

**Success Criteria:**
- 90% user satisfaction in beta testing for insight usefulness.
- Dashboards load <3s with 100+ properties.
- Exports accurate and compliant (e.g., GAAP-ready financials).

## Stories

1. **Story 20.1: Analytics Dashboard Foundation**
   - Core metrics aggregation (occupancy, revenue, expenses).
   - Basic charts (line/bar for trends) using Chart.js or Recharts.
   - Filter by property/date range.

2. **Story 20.2: Customizable Reports and Visualizations**
   - User-configurable widgets (drag/drop panels).
   - Advanced metrics (tenant churn, ROI calculations).
   - Interactive filters (multi-property selection).

3. **Story 20.3: Export and Compliance Features**
   - PDF/CSV export for reports.
   - Compliance templates (tax summaries, audit trails).
   - Scheduled report emails (integrate with notificationService).

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] No impact on existing payment/matching workflows.
- [ ] Data queries additive (no schema changes beyond indexes).
- [ ] UI extends current dashboard without breaking navigation.
- [ ] Performance: Queries optimized with indexes/caching.

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Data accuracy in aggregations (e.g., multi-tenant queries).
- **Mitigation:** Unit/integration tests for metrics; validate against sample data.
- **Rollback Plan:** Feature flag for new dashboard tab; disable exports if issues.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Existing analytics (Epic 17) integrated and enhanced.
- [ ] User testing confirms usability and accuracy.
