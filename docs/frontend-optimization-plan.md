# Frontend Optimization Plan

This document outlines the strategy for optimizing the frontend asset delivery to improve load times and overall user experience.

## Phase 1: Asset Minification and Compression (Task 128.5)

**Objective:** Ensure that all assets (JavaScript, CSS, SVGs) are minified and compressed to reduce their file size.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Verify Existing Compression:**
    *   The `dashboard/config-overrides.js` file already includes `compression-webpack-plugin` for Gzip and `brotli-webpack-plugin` for Brotli compression.
    *   Run a production build (`npm run build` in the `dashboard` directory) and verify that `.gz` and `.br` files are generated for the main asset bundles.

2.  **Image Optimization:**
    *   Integrate an image optimization pipeline into the build process.
    *   Use a library like `imagemin-webpack-plugin` to compress JPEG, PNG, and SVG images.
    *   Consider converting images to modern formats like WebP, which offer better compression than traditional formats.

3.  **Code Splitting:**
    *   Analyze the main application bundle to identify opportunities for code splitting.
    *   Use dynamic `import()` statements to split large components or libraries into separate chunks that are loaded on demand.
    *   This will reduce the initial load time of the application.

## Phase 2: Content Delivery Network (CDN)

**Objective:** Use a CDN to deliver assets to users from a location that is geographically closer to them, reducing latency.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Choose a CDN Provider:**
    *   Evaluate different CDN providers (e.g., AWS CloudFront, Cloudflare, Fastly) based on performance, cost, and ease of integration.

2.  **Configure the CDN:**
    *   Configure the CDN to cache the application's static assets (JS, CSS, images).
    *   Update the application to serve assets from the CDN.

3.  **Cache Busting:**
    *   Ensure that the build process generates unique filenames for each build (e.g., using a hash in the filename).
    *   This will prevent users from receiving stale cached versions of the assets.

## Phase 3: Performance Monitoring

**Objective:** Continuously monitor the application's performance to identify and address any regressions.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Implement Performance Monitoring Tools:**
    *   Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights, WebPageTest, or Lighthouse to analyze the application's performance.
    *   Integrate a performance monitoring service (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) to track key performance metrics in real-time.

2.  **Set Performance Budgets:**
    *   Define performance budgets for key metrics like First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), and bundle size.
    *   Configure the build process to fail if the performance budgets are exceeded.
