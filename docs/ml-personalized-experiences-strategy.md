# ML-Optimized Personalized Experiences Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for leveraging machine learning to optimize and personalize user experiences across the platform.

## 1. Vision and Goals

Our vision is to create a platform that adapts to each user's needs and preferences, providing a seamless and intuitive experience.

### Goals:

-   Increase user engagement and satisfaction.
-   Improve user retention.
-   Drive conversions and revenue.
-   Reduce user friction and support requests.

## 2. Target Personas and Use Cases

We will focus on two main personas:

-   **Tenants**: Personalize property recommendations, communication, and support.
-   **Property Managers**: Provide personalized insights, recommendations, and automated workflows.

### Use Cases:

-   **Personalized Property Recommendations**: Recommend properties to tenants based on their search history, preferences, and behavior.
-   **Personalized Communication**: Tailor communication to each user's preferred channel, tone, and frequency.
-   **Personalized Support**: Proactively address user issues and provide personalized support content.
-   **Personalized Insights**: Provide property managers with personalized insights and recommendations for optimizing their operations.

## 3. Data Requirements and Collection

We will need to collect and process the following data:

-   **User Data**: Demographics, preferences, and behavior.
-   **Property Data**: Listings, amenities, and pricing.
-   **Interaction Data**: Clicks, searches, and messages.

## 4. ML Models and Algorithms

We will use a combination of the following ML models and algorithms:

-   **Collaborative Filtering**: For personalized recommendations.
-   **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For personalized communication and support.
-   **Predictive Analytics**: For personalized insights and recommendations.

## 5. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Data Collection and Infrastructure (Q3 2025)

-   Implement data collection pipelines for all required data sources.
-   Set up a data warehouse for storing and processing the data.
-   Develop a feature store for managing ML features.

### Phase 2: Model Development and Training (Q4 2025)

-   Develop and train initial models for personalized recommendations and communication.
-   Integrate the models with the platform.
-   A/B test the models to measure their impact on user engagement and satisfaction.

### Phase 3: Model Deployment and Optimization (Q1 2026)

-   Deploy the models to production.
-   Monitor model performance and retrain as needed.
-   Continuously optimize the models to improve their accuracy and impact.

## 6. Success Metrics and KPIs

We will track the following metrics to measure the success of our personalization efforts:

-   **User Engagement**: Click-through rate, time on site, and conversion rate.
-   **User Satisfaction**: Net Promoter Score (NPS) and customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores.
-   **User Retention**: Churn rate and repeat usage.
-   **Revenue**: Average revenue per user (ARPU) and customer lifetime value (CLV).
