# NLP Model Development & Deployment Framework

This document outlines the comprehensive framework for developing, deploying, and managing Natural Language Processing (NLP) models at PropertyAI.

## 1. Core Requirements & Success Metrics

### 1.1. Key Stakeholders
- AI/ML Engineering Team
- Data Science Team
- Product Management
- Legal & Compliance
- Executive Leadership

### 1.2. Success Metrics
- **Model Performance:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, etc.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Latency, throughput, resource utilization.
- **Business Impact:** Cost savings, revenue generation, user satisfaction.
- **Adoption Rate:** Number of services/products using the NLP models.

## 2. Quality Standards & Ethical Guidelines

### 2.1. Data Governance
- **Privacy:** All data must be handled in compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations.
- **Security:** Data must be stored securely, with access controls in place.
- **Sourcing:** Data sources must be vetted for quality and bias.

### 2.2. Ethical AI Principles
- **Fairness:** Models should be evaluated for bias and fairness across different user groups.
- **Transparency:** Model decisions should be explainable and interpretable.
- **Accountability:** Clear ownership and responsibility for model behavior.

## 3. Model Development Lifecycle

### 3.1. Version Control
- **Data:** DVC or similar tools for versioning datasets.
- **Code:** Git for versioning code.
- **Models:** MLflow or similar for versioning models.

### 3.2. Evaluation Metrics
- **Text Classification:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Per-entity F1-score, overall accuracy.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## 4. Governance Policies

### 4.1. Roles & Responsibilities
- **AI Lead:** Overall responsibility for the NLP framework.
- **Data Governance Team:** Ensures compliance with data policies.
- **Legal/Compliance:** Reviews and approves models for legal and ethical risks.

### 4.2. Review & Approval Process
- All models must go through a rigorous review process before deployment.
- This includes a review of the model's performance, fairness, and security.

## 5. Development Environment & MLOps Toolchain

### 5.1. Tools & Technologies
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
- **Data Storage:** AWS S3, PostgreSQL
- **Compute Resources:** AWS EC2, AWS SageMaker
- **Experiment Tracking:** MLflow
- **Code Repositories:** Git (GitHub)
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (Amazon EKS)
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- **Model Serving:** FastAPI, AWS SageMaker Endpoints
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, Amazon CloudWatch

## 6. Framework Documentation, Training, and Maintenance

### 6.1. Documentation
- **Framework Architecture:** Detailed diagrams and descriptions of the end-to-end NLP framework.
- **Tool Usage:** Guides on how to use each tool in the MLOps toolchain.
- **Pipeline Operations:** Instructions on how to run, customize, and troubleshoot the pipelines.
- **Deployment Procedures:** Step-by-step instructions for deploying models to different environments.
- **Monitoring Dashboards:** Information on how to interpret the monitoring dashboards and alerts.
- **Troubleshooting Guides:** A collection of common issues and their resolutions.
- **Governance Protocols:** A detailed explanation of the governance policies and procedures.

### 6.2. Training
- **Onboarding:** New team members will go through a structured onboarding process to learn about the framework.
- **Workshops:** Regular workshops will be conducted to keep the team updated on new features and best practices.
- **Office Hours:** Dedicated time slots for team members to ask questions and get help.

### 6.3. Maintenance
- **Framework Updates:** The framework will be updated regularly to incorporate new tools and technologies.
- **Model Retraining:** Models will be retrained periodically to ensure they are up-to-date.
- **Model Retirement:** Models that are no longer performing well will be retired.
- **Periodic Review:** The framework will be reviewed periodically to ensure it is still effective and compliant with all policies.
