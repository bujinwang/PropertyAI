# Password Reset Flow Security Test Plan

This document outlines the security test plan for the password reset flow.

## 1. Token Generation and Validation

- **Test Case 1.1:** Verify that password reset tokens are unique and cryptographically secure.
- **Test Case 1.2:** Verify that tokens expire after the configured duration.
- **Test Case 1.3:** Verify that a token cannot be used more than once.
- **Test Case 1.4:** Verify that the system handles invalid or malformed tokens gracefully.

## 2. Email Security

- **Test Case 2.1:** Verify that the password reset email is sent only to the registered email address of the user.
- **Test Case 2.2:** Verify that the email content does not expose any sensitive information other than the reset link.

## 3. Password Complexity

- **Test Case 3.1:** Verify that the new password adheres to the defined complexity rules (e.g., length, character types).
- **Test Case 3.2:** Verify that the user receives a clear error message if the new password does not meet the complexity requirements.

## 4. Session Invalidation

- **Test Case 4.1:** Verify that all active sessions for a user are invalidated upon a successful password reset.
