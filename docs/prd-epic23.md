# PropertyAI Epic 23 Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Analysis Source
- IDE-based fresh analysis (leveraging existing docs like development-phase-transition-summary.md, architecture/data-models.md, and UAT feedback-summary.md). No prior document-project output found for Epic 23, but Epic 21's brownfield architecture provides baseline context.

### Current Project State
PropertyAI is a full-stack AI-driven property management platform with backend services (Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL/MongoDB), frontend dashboard (React/TS), and AI analytics (predictive maintenance, churn prediction, market trends). Epic 21 delivered core AI features with 4.4/5 UAT satisfaction, but identified gaps in mobile responsiveness, alert usability, and automation. The system is deployed locally via docker-compose for simulation, with infrastructure ready for Kubernetes scaling.

### Enhancement Scope Definition
#### Enhancement Type
- UI/UX Overhaul (primary: mobile optimization, alert grouping, templates)
- New Feature Addition (historical data access, automated actions)

#### Enhancement Description
Enhance PropertyAI's dashboard for better mobile usability and proactive management by grouping alerts, enabling customizable templates, adding historical data views, and introducing basic automation rules—directly addressing UAT feedback to boost satisfaction from 4.4/5 to 4.8+.

#### Impact Assessment
- Moderate Impact: UI changes to existing dashboard components (e.g., MaintenanceAlerts.tsx, PredictiveMaintenanceDashboard.tsx); backend extensions for data/history (minimal schema changes); new automation service integration without altering core AI models.

### Goals and Background Context
#### Goals
- Improve mobile accessibility for on-the-go property managers (target: 4.7/5 UX rating).
- Reduce alert fatigue through intelligent grouping and customization.
- Enable historical trend analysis to inform decisions beyond real-time predictions.
- Introduce simple automation to act on AI insights (e.g., auto-notify for high-risk maintenance).

#### Background Context
UAT for Epic 21 highlighted strong AI accuracy (4.6/5) but UI friction on mobile (4.2/5) and scattered alerts, limiting daily usability for field teams. These enhancements build on Epic 21's analytics foundation, integrating seamlessly with existing services (e.g., marketDataService.ts) to deliver a more actionable platform without overhauling the architecture.

## Requirements

### Functional
- FR1: Users can access all dashboard features on mobile devices with responsive layouts and touch-friendly interactions.
- FR2: Alerts are grouped by type (maintenance, churn, market) and priority, with customizable views (e.g., filter by property or severity).
- FR3: Users can create and apply customizable templates for reports and dashboards, saving preferences per user/role.
- FR4: Historical data views allow querying past AI predictions and trends (e.g., 6-12 months), integrated with current analytics.
- FR5: Basic automation rules enable actions like auto-email for high-risk alerts or scheduling maintenance based on AI scores.

### Non Functional
- NFR1: Mobile UI must load in <3s on 3G connections and support offline caching for key views.
- NFR2: Alert grouping must handle 1000+ alerts/day without performance degradation (>95% uptime).
- NFR3: Historical data queries must complete in <5s for 1-year range, using existing DB indexes.
- NFR4: Automation rules must integrate with existing notification system without introducing new single points of failure.
- NFR5: All enhancements must maintain Epic 21's 4.6/5 AI accuracy and 100% test coverage.

### Compatibility Requirements
- CR1: Existing API endpoints (e.g., /api/predictive-maintenance) remain unchanged; new endpoints prefixed /api/epic23/.
- CR2: Database schema additions are additive (no migrations breaking Epic 21 data); use new tables for history/automation.
- CR3: UI changes extend React components (e.g., MaintenanceAlerts.tsx) without altering core props/interfaces.
- CR4: Integrations with external services (e.g., market data APIs) must preserve current auth and rate limits.

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI
New mobile-optimized components will extend existing React/TS patterns (e.g., use Tailwind for responsiveness, integrate with dashboard/src/services). Alert grouping will modify ChurnRiskAlerts.tsx and MaintenanceAlerts.tsx, adding filters while preserving desktop layout.

### Modified/New Screens and Views
- Modified: PredictiveMaintenanceDashboard.tsx (add historical tab), MarketTrendsDashboard.tsx (mobile charts), PropertyDetail.tsx (automation rules panel).
- New: HistoricalDataView.tsx (trends page), AlertTemplatesEditor.tsx (customization modal).

### UI Consistency Requirements
- Maintain blue-gray color scheme and sans-serif typography from Epic 21.
- Touch targets ≥48px for mobile; hamburger menu for navigation on small screens.
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, extending Epic 21's ARIA labels.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack
**Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js backend, React frontend).  
**Frameworks**: Express.js (API), React 18 (UI), Tailwind CSS (styling).  
**Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), MongoDB (analytics logs).  
**Infrastructure**: Docker/Kubernetes (deployment), GKE (cloud).  
**External Dependencies**: Market data APIs (e.g., Zillow-like), email services (SendGrid).

### Integration Approach
**Database Integration Strategy**: Add tables for alert_groups, user_templates, historical_logs, automation_rules; use existing models (e.g., extend Property model for history).  
**API Integration Strategy**: New routes under /api/v2/epic23/; proxy to Epic 21 endpoints for compatibility.  
**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Hook into existing state management (e.g., Redux/Context for alerts); responsive with CSS media queries.  
**Testing Integration Strategy**: Extend Jest tests; add E2E for mobile (Cypress with device emulation).

### Code Organization and Standards
**File Structure Approach**: New folders dashboard/src/epic23/ for UI, src/services/epic23/ for backend; follow unified-project-structure.md.  
**Naming Conventions**: camelCase for JS/TS, kebab-case for files (e.g., alert-grouping.service.ts).  
**Coding Standards**: Adhere to docs/coding-standards.md (ESLint, Prettier); async/await over promises.  
**Documentation Standards**: JSDoc for new functions; update READMEs in affected folders.

### Deployment and Operations
**Build Process Integration**: Extend npm scripts (add epic23-build); no changes to main pipeline.  
**Deployment Strategy**: Feature flags via config (e.g., enable_epic23: false initially); gradual rollout as in Epic 21.  
**Monitoring and Logging**: Integrate with existing epic21-dashboard.json; add metrics for new endpoints (Prometheus).  
**Configuration Management**: Use .env vars for new features (e.g., AUTOMATION_ENABLED).

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation
**Technical Risks**: Mobile UI breaks on older browsers—Mitigation: Test on iOS/Android 10+; use polyfills.  
**Integration Risks**: Alert grouping overloads DB—Mitigation: Indexing on alert_type/priority; pagination.  
**Deployment Risks**: Automation rules cause loops—Mitigation: Rate limits and dry-run mode.  
**Mitigation Strategies**: Incremental stories (UI first, then backend); 80% test coverage minimum; rollback to Epic 21 state.

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach
**Epic Structure Decision**: Single epic for Epic 23 with rationale: UAT priorities are interconnected (mobile UI enables better alert interaction, which supports automation), allowing cohesive development without silos. This minimizes integration risks in the brownfield context.

## Epic Details

### Epic 1: PropertyAI Usability and Automation Enhancements

**Epic Goal**: Deliver user-centric improvements to make PropertyAI more mobile-friendly and proactive, addressing UAT gaps to increase adoption and satisfaction.

**Integration Requirements**: All new features must extend Epic 21 APIs/components without breaking changes; use feature flags for safe rollout; maintain 100% backward compatibility for existing analytics.
