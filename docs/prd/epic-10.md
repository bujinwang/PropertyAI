# Epic 10: Advanced Reporting

## Goal
Enhance the PropertyAI dashboard with advanced reporting and analytics capabilities to provide property managers with comprehensive insights, custom dashboards, and automated report generation for data-driven decision making.

## Description
This brownfield enhancement adds sophisticated reporting features to the PropertyAI system, leveraging the comprehensive data now available across all domains (properties, units, tenants, leases, maintenance, financial, documents, communications, and users). The implementation will include:

- Custom dashboard analytics with configurable widgets and KPIs
- Interactive charts and graphs for key performance indicators
- Automated report generation and scheduling
- Export capabilities in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV)
- Historical trend analysis and forecasting
- Performance benchmarking and comparative analytics
- Real-time data visualization and alerts

## Stories
- **Story 10.1**: Custom Dashboard Analytics
  - Create configurable dashboard widgets for key metrics (occupancy rates, revenue trends, maintenance costs, tenant satisfaction)
  - Implement interactive charts (line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, heat maps)
  - Add date range filtering and comparison periods
  - Include real-time data updates with refresh capabilities
  - Support custom KPI calculations and alerts

- **Story 10.2**: Report Generation and Export
  - Build automated report templates for common use cases (monthly financial reports, occupancy reports, maintenance summaries)
  - Implement export functionality (PDF, Excel, CSV formats)
  - Add scheduled report delivery system with email notifications
  - Create custom report builder with drag-and-drop interface
  - Include data visualization options and formatting controls

## Compatibility Requirements
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing dashboard layout and navigation
- Should work across all supported browsers and devices
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing features
- Should leverage existing API endpoints and data structures

## Risk Mitigation
- Implement progressive enhancement - new features don't break existing functionality
- Use established charting libraries compatible with Material UI
- Add comprehensive error handling for data loading and export operations
- Include loading states and user feedback for long-running operations
- Implement data caching to optimize performance
