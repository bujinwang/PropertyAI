# Epic 12: Mobile App Companion

## üéØ **Goal**
Create a React Native mobile application that provides property managers and tenants with mobile access to core PropertyAI features, enabling on-the-go property management and tenant communication.

## üìã **Description**
This brownfield enhancement adds a companion mobile app to the existing PropertyAI web platform. The mobile app will provide essential functionality for property managers to monitor properties, handle maintenance requests, and communicate with tenants while on the move. Tenants will be able to submit maintenance requests, make payments, and receive notifications.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo for cross-platform development
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for complex state management
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6 with tab and stack navigators
- **API Integration**: RESTful API integration with existing backend
- **Offline Support**: SQLite for offline data storage and sync
- **Authentication**: JWT token-based auth with refresh token handling
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- **Platform Support**: iOS 12+ and Android API 21+

## üì± **Stories**

### Story 12.1: React Native App Setup & Authentication
**Objective**: Establish the mobile app foundation with authentication and basic navigation
- Set up React Native project with Expo
- Implement authentication flow (login/logout)
- Create basic navigation structure
- Integrate with existing API endpoints
- Add offline storage capabilities

### Story 12.2: Mobile Dashboard & Core Features
**Objective**: Implement core mobile functionality for property management
- Mobile-optimized dashboard with key metrics
- Property list and details views
- Maintenance request creation and tracking
- Payment processing integration
- Push notification handling
- Offline mode with data synchronization

## üîÑ **Compatibility Requirements**
- **Backward Compatibility**: No changes to existing web platform APIs
- **API Versioning**: Utilize existing API endpoints with mobile-specific optimizations
- **Data Synchronization**: Implement conflict resolution for offline/online sync
- **Security**: Maintain same security standards as web platform

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Mitigation**
- **Platform Fragmentation**: Use Expo managed workflow for consistent behavior
- **Performance**: Implement virtualization for large lists and optimize images
- **Offline Complexity**: Start with read-only offline mode, expand gradually
- **Testing**: Comprehensive device testing across iOS/Android versions

## ‚úÖ **Definition of Done**
