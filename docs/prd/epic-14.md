# Epic 14: Advanced Security & Compliance

## 🎯 **Goal**
Enhance the PropertyAI platform with enterprise-grade security features and compliance capabilities to protect sensitive property management data and ensure regulatory compliance.

## 📋 **Description**
This brownfield epic focuses on implementing advanced security measures and compliance reporting to protect tenant data, financial information, and property records. It builds upon existing authentication systems to provide multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, comprehensive audit trails, and automated compliance reporting.

## 🏗️ **Stories**
- **Story 14.1**: Enhanced Authentication & Authorization
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation
  - Advanced role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Session management and security policies
  - API security enhancements

- **Story 14.2**: Audit Trails & Compliance Reporting
  - Comprehensive audit logging system
  - Automated compliance reporting (GDPR, CCPA, SOX)
  - Data retention and deletion policies
  - Security incident monitoring and alerting

## 🔄 **Compatibility Requirements**
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing authentication methods remain functional
- **Data Migration**: Seamless transition to enhanced security without data loss
- **API Compatibility**: Existing API endpoints maintain functionality with added security layers
- **Mobile App**: Security enhancements extend to mobile companion app

## ⚠️ **Risk Mitigation**
- **Security Testing**: Comprehensive penetration testing and security audits
- **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert to previous authentication system if issues arise
- **Performance Impact**: Security measures optimized to minimize performance overhead
- **User Training**: Clear documentation and training for enhanced security features

## ✅ **Definition of Done**
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication implemented and tested
- [ ] Advanced RBAC system deployed with granular permissions
- [ ] Comprehensive audit trails capturing all user actions
- [ ] Automated compliance reporting for major regulations

## 📊 **Success Metrics**
- **Security Score**: Achieve 95%+ security rating
- **Compliance Coverage**: 100% coverage for GDPR, CCPA, SOX requirements
- **Performance**: <2% authentication overhead, <1% API response time increase
- **User Adoption**: 90%+ user adoption of MFA within 30 days
- **Incident Response**: <15 minute detection and response time for security events

## 🔗 **Dependencies**
- Existing user management system (Epic 9)
- Authentication infrastructure
- Database encryption capabilities
- Email/SMS notification system (Epic 8)

## 📅 **Timeline**
- **Story 14.1**: 2-3 weeks (Authentication & Authorization)
- **Story 14.2**: 2-3 weeks (Audit & Compliance)
- **Testing & Validation**: 1 week
- **Total**: 5-7 weeks

## 👥 **Stakeholders**
- **Security Team**: Responsible for security architecture and compliance
- **Development Team**: Implementation of security features
- **QA Team**: Security testing and validation
- **Legal/Compliance**: Regulatory requirements and audit preparation
- **Property Managers**: Enhanced security for their data
