# Epic 15: Advanced IoT Integration

## üéØ **Goal**
Transform PropertyAI into a smart property management platform by integrating IoT devices and sensors for automated monitoring, predictive maintenance, and enhanced property intelligence.

## üìã **Description**
This brownfield enhancement adds comprehensive IoT capabilities to the existing PropertyAI platform, enabling property managers to connect smart devices, monitor environmental conditions, and receive automated alerts. The integration will support various IoT protocols and provide real-time data analytics for proactive property management.

## üèóÔ∏è **Stories Outline**

### Story 15.1: Smart Device Connectivity
**Objective**: Implement device discovery, registration, and management system
- Device discovery and auto-registration via multiple protocols (MQTT, Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi)
- Device catalog with supported device types and capabilities
- Secure device authentication and authorization
- Device grouping and property-unit association
- Real-time device status monitoring and health checks
- Firmware update management and version control

### Story 15.2: Sensor Data Analytics & Monitoring
**Objective**: Build comprehensive sensor data processing and analytics platform
- Real-time sensor data ingestion and processing pipeline
- Environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity, air quality, occupancy)
- Predictive maintenance alerts based on sensor data patterns
- Energy consumption tracking and optimization recommendations
- Automated incident detection and alert system
- Historical data analytics and trend analysis
- Custom dashboard widgets for sensor data visualization

## üîß **Technical Requirements**
- **Protocols**: MQTT, Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth LE
- **Data Processing**: Real-time stream processing with <1 second latency
- **Storage**: Time-series database for sensor data with 1-year retention
- **Security**: Device-level authentication, encrypted data transmission
- **Scalability**: Support for 10,000+ devices per property
- **Integration**: RESTful APIs for third-party device manufacturers

## üîÑ **Compatibility Requirements**
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality remains unchanged
- **Database Extensions**: New tables for devices, sensors, and time-series data
- **API Extensions**: New IoT endpoints without breaking existing APIs
- **UI Integration**: New IoT sections in existing dashboard without disrupting current layout

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Mitigation**
- **Low-Risk Implementation**: IoT features are additive, not replacing core functionality
- **Gradual Rollout**: Features can be enabled per property as devices are added
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: System continues to function without IoT connectivity
- **Data Isolation**: IoT data stored separately from core property data
- **Rollback Plan**: IoT features can be disabled without data loss
