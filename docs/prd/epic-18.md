# Epic 18: AI-Powered Property Matching and Tenant Screening Marketplace

## Epic Goal

Create an AI-driven marketplace that connects property owners/managers with vetted tenants through intelligent matching algorithms and automated screening, reducing vacancy periods by 30% and improving tenant quality to enhance long-term property ROI.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
PropertyAI already manages comprehensive property and tenant data through its dashboard, mobile app, and backend systems. Tenant onboarding (Epic 3), property management (Epic 2), and analytics (Epic 17) provide rich data for matching. This epic builds on that foundation to create a marketplace feature that automates tenant-property pairing and screening.

**Enhancement Details:**
- **AI Matching Engine**: Use ML to match tenant preferences, financials, and behavior with property features, location, and owner criteria.
- **Automated Screening**: Integrate background checks, credit scoring, and reference verification with AI risk assessment.
- **Marketplace Interface**: Self-service tenant search, application submission, and owner review workflow.
- **Vetting & Approval**: Automated initial screening with human override for final decisions.
- **Integration**: Seamless data flow to existing lease management (Epic 4) and financial systems (Epic 6).

**Success Criteria:**
- 30% reduction in average vacancy fill time
- 25% increase in tenant application conversion rate
- 90% accuracy in AI matching recommendations
- Compliance with fair housing laws and data privacy (GDPR/CCPA)
- Mobile-friendly marketplace experience

## Stories

### Story 18.1: AI Matching Engine Implementation
**Goal:** Develop core ML models for intelligent tenant-property matching based on multi-factor scoring.

**Key Features:**
- Tenant profile scoring (income, preferences, history)
- Property suitability analysis (amenities, location, pricing)
- Matching algorithm with ranking and recommendations
- Owner preference integration for custom filters
- A/B testing framework for algorithm optimization

### Story 18.2: Automated Tenant Screening System
**Goal:** Build automated screening workflow with AI risk assessment and third-party integrations.

**Key Features:**
- Credit and background check API integrations (e.g., TransUnion, Checkr)
- AI-powered risk scoring based on screening data
- Automated reference verification and employment confirmation
- Red flag detection and escalation to owners
- Screening report generation and storage

### Story 18.3: Marketplace User Interface and Workflow
**Goal:** Create self-service marketplace interfaces for tenant search, applications, and owner approvals.

**Key Features:**
- Tenant search and matching dashboard
- Property listing optimization for marketplace visibility
- Application submission and tracking
- Owner review and approval workflow

- Training data from historical tenant/property data (anonymized)
- Model accuracy monitoring and retraining pipeline
- Explainable AI for matching decisions (fair housing compliance)

**API and Data Flow:**
- `/api/marketplace/match` - Generate tenant-property matches
- `/api/marketplace/screen` - Run tenant screening
- `/api/marketplace/application` - Manage applications and approvals
- Integration with existing auth (Epic 2) and financial verification (Epic 6)
- WebSocket for real-time match notifications

**Security & Compliance:**
- GDPR/CCPA compliant data handling for tenant info
- Fair housing algorithm auditing and bias detection
- Secure third-party API integrations with token management
- Audit logs for all screening and matching decisions
- User consent management for data usage in matching

**Performance:**
- Match generation <5 seconds for 100+ properties
- Screening results <30 seconds including API calls
- Marketplace search indexed for <1 second response
- Scalable to 10,000+ active listings

## Integration Points

**Existing Systems:**
- Property Management (Epic 2) - Property data and availability
- Tenant Management (Epic 3) - Tenant profiles and history
- Financial Management (Epic 6) - Income verification and credit data
- Analytics Engine (Epic 17) - ML model hosting and data insights
- Workflow Automation (Epic 16) - Application approval workflows

**External Integrations:**
- Credit bureaus (TransUnion, Equifax) for financial screening
- Background check services (Checkr, GoodHire)
- Identity verification (ID.me or similar)
- Email/SMS services for notifications (Twilio, SendGrid)

## Success Metrics

**Marketplace Adoption:**
- 500+ active tenant applications per month
- 200+ property listings in marketplace
- 70% application-to-lease conversion rate
- Average match time <7 days

**AI Effectiveness:**
- 90% user satisfaction with matching recommendations
- 85% accuracy in screening risk predictions
- <5% false positive rejections in automated screening
- Bias detection score <2% across protected classes

**Business Impact:**
- 30% reduction in vacancy fill time
- 20% increase in qualified tenant applications
- 15% improvement in tenant retention rates
- ROI: Marketplace subscription revenue target $50K/month

## Risk Mitigation

**Data Privacy Risks:**
- Strict consent management and data minimization
- Third-party vendor security audits
- Regular compliance reviews and legal consultation
- User data deletion capabilities

**Algorithm Bias Risks:**
- Regular fair housing audits and bias testing
- Diverse training data sets with demographic balancing
- Transparent matching criteria and appeal process
- Human override for all automated decisions

**Integration Risks:**
- Fallback mechanisms for third-party API failures
- Data validation at all integration points
- Graceful degradation for non-critical features
- Comprehensive error logging and monitoring

**Market Adoption Risks:**
- Pilot program with select properties before full rollout
- User feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Marketing and onboarding support for early adopters
- Competitive analysis and differentiation strategy
