# Epic 2: Property Listing Management - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Enable property managers to create, view, update, and delete property listings through the dashboard, providing a complete CRUD interface to manage real estate assets efficiently.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: Dashboard displays summaries from backend data (properties, units via Prisma schema). APIs exist for fetching property data.
- Technology stack: React with Material UI for frontend, Node.js/Prisma for backend.
- Integration points: Extend Dashboard page, use existing backend APIs (e.g., /api/properties), update schema if needed.

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Full CRUD operations for properties (create new listing, edit details, view list, delete). Include unit association.
- How it integrates: Add new pages/routes in dashboard/src/pages (e.g., PropertyList.tsx, PropertyForm.tsx); hook into existing navigation sidebar.
- Success criteria: Managers can manage 100+ properties without performance issues; all operations persist to database; UI matches dashboard style.

## Stories

1. **Story 2.1: Implement Property Listing CRUD UI** - Create forms and lists for creating/editing/viewing/deleting properties using Material UI components, integrating with backend APIs.
2. **Story 2.2: Property-Unit Association Management** - Add functionality to associate units with properties, including bulk operations and validation.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged (extend with new endpoints if needed).
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible (add fields to existing Property model).
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns (Material UI Cards, Lists, responsive design).
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (paginate lists, optimize queries).

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Data inconsistency during CRUD operations affecting dashboard summaries.
- **Mitigation:** Implement optimistic updates and error handling; add validation on forms.
- **Rollback Plan:** Revert new components/files; database migrations can be rolled back using Prisma commands.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing (dashboard data refresh post-CRUD)
- [ ] Integration points working correctly (API calls, navigation)
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately (add to dev notes in stories)
- [ ] No regression in existing features (run full test suite)
