# Epic 8: Communication Tools

## Goal
Enable effective communication between property managers and tenants through a comprehensive messaging system and notification management to improve operational efficiency and tenant satisfaction.

## Description
This epic introduces communication tools to the PropertyAI dashboard, allowing property managers to send direct messages to tenants, create and manage announcements, and handle automated notifications for important events like maintenance updates, payment reminders, and lease changes. The implementation will be a brownfield enhancement that integrates seamlessly with existing tenant, property, and lease data.
