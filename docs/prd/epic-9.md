# Epic 9: User Management

## Goal
Implement a comprehensive user management system with role-based access control to ensure secure, scalable access to PropertyAI features based on user responsibilities and permissions.

## Description
This brownfield enhancement adds user management capabilities to the PropertyAI system, enabling property managers to control access to different features and data based on user roles. The implementation will include:

- Role-based permission system with granular access controls
- User account management with profile customization
- Multi-tenant support for different property portfolios
- Audit logging for security and compliance
- Password policies and security best practices
- User onboarding and invitation workflows

## Stories
- **Story 9.1**: User Roles and Permissions
  - Define role hierarchy (Admin, Manager, Staff, Tenant)

  - Create role assignment and management interface
  - Add permission validation throughout the application

- **Story 9.2**: User Account Management
  - Build user profile management with customizable settings
  - Implement user invitation and onboarding system
  - Add account deactivation and data retention policies
  - Create user activity monitoring and audit trails

## Compatibility Requirements
- Must integrate with existing authentication system
- Should maintain backward compatibility with current user access
- Must work with existing database schema and API patterns
- Should support both individual and bulk user operations

## Risk Mitigation
- Implement gradual rollout with feature flags
- Add comprehensive permission validation to prevent unauthorized access
- Include audit logging for all user management operations
- Provide clear user feedback for permission-related actions
