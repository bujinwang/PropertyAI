# PropertyAI Epic 23 Brownfield Enhancement PRD

This document has been sharded for better navigation and maintainability. The full PRD is organized into sections below, each as a separate file.

## Sections

- [Intro Project Analysis and Context](./intro-project-analysis-and-context.md)
- [Requirements](./requirements.md)
- [User Interface Enhancement Goals](./user-interface-enhancement-goals.md)
- [Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements](./technical-constraints-and-integration-requirements.md)
- [Epic and Story Structure](./epic-and-story-structure.md)
- [Epic Details](./epic-details.md)

For the complete un-sharded version, see the original docs/prd-epic23.md. This sharding follows the brownfield PRD template structure, with level 2 headings as top-level files. All content integrity is preserved, including tables and lists.
