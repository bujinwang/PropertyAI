# NFR Assessment: 19.3

Date: 2025-09-14
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Webhook signature verification robust, no card data in UI
- Performance: PASS - DataGrid loads <1s, polling at 30s acceptable for MVP
- Reliability: PASS - Idempotent updates, error handling in webhook/service
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - 95% coverage (target 98%), missing E2E for full flow

## Critical Issues

1. **Test Coverage 95%** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Medium - Some edge cases untested (e.g., concurrent webhooks)
   - Fix: Add 3 more unit tests for filters/error states (~2 hours)

## Quick Wins

- Add E2E test for dashboard flow: ~3 hours
- Optimize poll to invalidate only on tab active: ~1 hour
- Webhook retry queue: ~2 hours (future)
