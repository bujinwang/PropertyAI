## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| SEC-001  | Webhook signature tampering | Low (1)    | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |
| PERF-001 | Polling causes high server load | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| REL-001  | Concurrent webhook updates cause race conditions | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| REL-002  | Notification delivery failure | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **PERF-001**: Load test polling with 100 concurrent users
  - Test type: Performance
  - Description: Simulate 30s poll from multiple clients, monitor CPU/memory

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **REL-001**: Concurrent webhook test
  - Test type: Integration
  - Description: Send multiple succeeded events simultaneously, verify no duplicate updates

- **SEC-001**: Webhook security test
  - Test type: Security
  - Description: Send tampered signatures, verify 400 response

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### SEC-001: Webhook signature tampering

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Stripe sig is robust
**Impact**: High - Could update wrong statuses
**Mitigation**:
- preventive: Use stripe.webhooks.constructEvent
- detective: Log all failed verifications
- Testing: Unit test invalid sig rejection
**Residual Risk**: Low - Zero-day sig vuln unlikely
**Owner**: dev
**Timeline**: Before deployment

### PERF-001: Polling causes high server load

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - 30s poll with many users
**Impact**: High - Degrades /history performance
**Mitigation**:
- preventive: Implement caching (Redis) for history
- corrective: Reduce to 60s or WebSockets in v2
- Testing: Load test with Artillery or k6
**Residual Risk**: Medium - Until optimized
**Owner**: dev
**Timeline**: Post-MVP

### REL-001: Concurrent webhook updates

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Rare but possible
**Impact**: Medium - Status inconsistency
**Mitigation**:
- preventive: Idempotency check (status === pending)
- Testing: Concurrent test with 10 events
**Residual Risk**: Low
**Owner**: dev

### REL-002: Notification delivery failure

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Mock/retry logic
**Impact**: Medium - User not informed
**Mitigation**:
- detective: Log failures, retry 3x
- Testing: Mock send failure, verify retry
**Residual Risk**: Low
**Owner**: dev

## Monitoring Requirements

- Webhook failures: Alert on 400/500 rates >5%
- Poll load: Monitor /history calls/min
- Notification success: Track delivery rates

## Risk Review Triggers

- New Stripe event types added
- Frontend user base >100
- Performance degradation reported
