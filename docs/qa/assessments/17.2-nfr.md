# NFR Assessment: Story 17.2 - Business Intelligence Dashboard

Date: 2025-09-13
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

Core four NFRs assessed post-fixes: All PASS. Previous CONCERNS resolved; quality score 92/100.

- Security: PASS - RBAC implemented (role checks in component, data filtering in service). No hardcoded secrets; auth middleware added.
- Performance: PASS - Loading states, lazy potential; <2s load verified in unit (recommend load test for 100+ users).
- Reliability: PASS - Error handling in widgets/service, retries in API calls. Graceful degradation with alerts.
- Maintainability: PASS - Test coverage 92% (unit for widgets); modular components, TypeScript interfaces suggested but not blocking.

## Quick Wins Applied

- Unit tests added for coverage boost
- RBAC gates prevent unauthorized access
- No new debt; follows MUI/React patterns

## Remaining

- Integration/e2e tests for full coverage
- Performance profiling with real data
