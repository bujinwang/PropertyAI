# Risk Profile: Story 17.2 - Business Intelligence Dashboard

Date: 2025-09-13
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Risk Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4 (down from 6 pre-fixes)
- Critical Risks: 0 (resolved: test coverage, RBAC gaps)
- High Risks: 0
- Medium Risks: 1 (integration/e2e testing for full flows)
- Low Risks: 3 (perf profiling, accessibility audit, scalability load test)
- Overall Score: 92/100 (improved from 70)

## Resolved Risks

- **Test Coverage <85%** (High): Fixed with unit tests for widgets; coverage 92%
- **RBAC Missing** (High): Implemented role gates in component/service; data filtered by user properties

## Remaining Risks

- **Integration Gaps** (Medium): No full integration tests for dashboard-service flow; risk of undetected regressions. Mitigation: Add integration tests before production.
- **Performance with Real Data** (Low): Unit benchmarks pass, but load test with large datasets needed. Action: Profile <2s load.
- **Accessibility Full Audit** (Low): WCAG unit checks ok; full audit pending. Action: Run tools for AA compliance.
- **Scalability Verification** (Low): 100+ users untested. Action: Load test in staging.

Recommendations: Must-fix: Integration tests. Future: Load testing.
