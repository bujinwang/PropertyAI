# NFR Assessment: 18.1

Date: 2025-09-13
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Good PII handling but bias risk in ML requires mitigation
- Performance: CONCERNS - Code efficient but no load tests; <5s SLA unverified
- Reliability: PASS - Solid error handling and DB integration
- Maintainability: PASS - Modular services, 88% unit coverage, clear structure

## Critical Issues

1. **Algorithm Bias Risk** (Security)
   - Risk: High probability of fair housing violations
   - Fix: Implement parity checks in generateMatches; add bias tests

2. **Performance Verification Missing** (Performance)
   - Risk: Potential SLA failure under load
   - Fix: Add k6 load tests for 100+ matches (<5s)

## Quick Wins

- Bias detection: 2 hours (unit test + parity logic)
- Load testing setup: 3 hours (k6 script + baseline)
- Logging enhancement: 1 hour (structured logs for audits)
