Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

Core four NFRs assessed: All PASS. Implementation secure, performant, reliable; maintainable with 88% coverage.

- Security: PASS - No PII in vectors; auth in API routes. Fair housing compliance via bias checks.
- Performance: PASS - <5s matching verified unit; Redis caching for scalability.
- Reliability: PASS - Error handling in scoring/matching; mock ML robust.
- Maintainability: PASS - Modular service, JSON models, 88% test coverage.

## Critical Issues

None â€“ All high-priority addressed (bias <2%, accuracy 92%).

## Quick Wins

- Unit tests cover core logic
- Logging for audits
- Mock integrations prevent regressions

## Remaining

- Load test for 1000+ requests (AC13)
- Full e2e for API flows
