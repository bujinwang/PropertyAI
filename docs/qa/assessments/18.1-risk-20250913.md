# Risk Profile: Story 18.1

Date: 2025-09-13
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 68/100 (moderate risk due to ML integration and performance)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Algorithm Bias in Matching

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - ML models can inherit biases from training data
**Impact**: High - Fair housing violations, legal liability, reputation damage
**Mitigation**:

- Implement bias detection in generateMatches (demographic parity check)
- Use diverse, audited training data
- Add explainable AI for match reasons
- Regular model audits with third-party validation
**Testing Focus**: Unit tests for parity <2%; integration tests with synthetic biased data

### 2. PERF-001: Matching Performance Under Load

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - TF.js computation scales with property count
**Impact**: High - >5s response breaks SLA, user abandonment
**Mitigation**:

- Cache frequent scores in Redis
- Optimize vector computations (batch processing)
- Limit initial matches to top 50
- Implement async processing for large sets
**Testing Focus**: Load tests with 1000+ concurrent requests

### 3. TECH-001: Integration with Existing Services

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Dependencies on tenant/property services
**Impact**: High - Could break core functionality if updates fail
**Mitigation**:

- Use existing service mocks in tests
- Add integration tests for scoreTenant/scoreProperty calls
- Feature flag for new matching logic
- Rollback to basic matching if issues detected
**Testing Focus**: Integration tests for service interactions

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Bias detection tests (SEC-001)
- Load tests for matching SLA (PERF-001)
- Integration tests for service calls (TECH-001)

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- API security tests (rate limiting, auth)
- DB performance profiling

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Data anonymization verification
- Logging coverage

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (SEC-001)
- High risks affecting security/performance

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with monitoring
- Low risks documented

### Accepted Risks

- None at this time

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Matching response times (PERF-001)
- Bias metrics in logs (SEC-001)
- Service integration errors (TECH-001)
- API usage patterns

## Risk Review Triggers

Review when:

- New training data added
- Performance degradation detected
- Regulatory changes in fair housing
- Integration service updates
