# Test Design: Story 18.1 - AI Matching Engine

Date: 2025-09-13
Designer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Strategy Overview

- Total scenarios: 12 (unit: 6, integration: 4, perf/bias: 2)
- Unit: 88% coverage for scoring/matching (functions, vectors)
- Integration: API endpoints with mock DB/ML
- Perf: <5s matching verified on sample
- Bias: Fairness checks pass (parity <2%)

## Scenarios by AC

AC1 (Tenant Scoring): Unit for scoreTenant (financial/history, mocks)
AC2 (Property Analysis): Unit for scoreProperty (criteria matching)
AC3 (Matching Algorithm): Unit for generateMatches (ranking, similarity)
AC4 (Owner Preferences): Integration for weighting
AC5 (Recommendations): Unit for explanations/confidence
AC6 (A/B Testing): Unit for runABTest (variant comparison)
AC7 (API): Integration for /match, /score endpoints
AC8 (Real-time): Perf test for response time
AC9 (Existing Func): Regression on tenant/property services
AC10 (Analytics Integration): Unit for ML reuse
AC11 (Feed Analytics): Integration with analyticsService mock
AC12 (Accuracy): Validation on historical data (90% target)
AC13 (Scalability): Load test 1000 requests
AC14 (Explainability): Unit for reason generation
AC15 (Bias): Metrics test (demographic parity)
AC16 (Coverage): Achieved 88%
