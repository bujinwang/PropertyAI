- No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data exposure

**Key Security Features:**
- Authentication middleware applied to all routes
- Request sanitization and validation

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Database indexing on risk-related fields (entityType, entityId, assessmentDate, riskLevel)
- Caching layer for frequently accessed risk data
- Asynchronous processing for computationally intensive operations
- Efficient data structures for risk factor calculations

**Load Testing Results:**
- Handles concurrent assessments without degradation
- Memory usage remains stable under load

- Consistent naming conventions throughout
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Modular architecture with clear dependencies
- Proper error handling and logging

**Architecture Quality:**
- Service layer abstraction for business logic
- Repository pattern for data access

- API endpoint documentation with examples
- Database schema documentation
- Architecture decision records
- Test case documentation

**Technical Debt:**
- Minimal technical debt identified
- Code follows established patterns
- Consistent technology stack usage
