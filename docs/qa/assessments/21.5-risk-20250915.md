## Critical Risks (Score ≥ 9)

None identified

## High Risks (Score 6-8)

### TECH-001: Complex risk algorithms may have edge case failures
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability:** Medium - Complex algorithms always have edge cases
**Impact:** High - Incorrect risk assessments could lead to poor business decisions
**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive unit test coverage for all risk calculation methods
- Input validation and sanitization for all data sources
- Error handling with fallback to conservative risk estimates
- Algorithm validation against known test scenarios

## Medium Risks (Score 4-5)

### DATA-001: Historical data quality affects algorithm accuracy
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability:** Medium - Data quality varies by source and completeness
**Impact:** Medium - Reduced accuracy may affect confidence in risk assessments
**Mitigation:**
- Data quality validation before risk calculations
- Confidence scoring that reflects data quality
- Clear indicators when assessments are based on incomplete data
- Regular data quality monitoring and alerts

## Low Risks (Score 2-3)

### PERF-001: Large portfolio assessments may timeout
**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability:** Low - Performance optimizations implemented
**Impact:** High - Could affect user experience for large portfolios
**Mitigation:**

- Caching layer for frequently accessed risk data
- Asynchronous processing for large portfolios
- Progress indicators for long-running assessments

### SEC-001: Risk data exposure through API endpoints
**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability:** Low - Security measures implemented
**Impact:** High - Sensitive risk data could be exposed
**Mitigation:**
- JWT authentication on all endpoints
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and SQL injection protection
- Audit logging for all risk data access

## Risk Distribution by Category

- **Technical:** 1 risk (25%)

- **API Layer:** 1 risk

## Mitigation Strategy Summary

### Immediate Actions Required
None - All risks are mitigated or monitored

### Monitoring Required
- Algorithm accuracy validation with real data
- Performance metrics for large portfolio assessments
- Data quality indicators and alerts

### Contingency Plans
- Fallback risk calculation methods for edge cases
- Manual risk assessment override capabilities
- Data quality improvement procedures

## Risk-Based Testing Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Path Tests
- Algorithm accuracy validation with diverse test data
- Edge case handling in risk calculations
- Performance testing with large datasets

### Priority 2: Integration Tests
- End-to-end risk assessment workflows
- Data quality validation scenarios
- Security testing for API endpoints

### Priority 3: Monitoring Tests
- Performance regression tests
- Data quality monitoring alerts
- Error handling and recovery scenarios

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Acceptable Risk Levels
- **Critical Risks:** 0 (Zero tolerance)
- **High Risks:** 0 (Must be mitigated)
- **Medium Risks:** ≤2 (Acceptable with monitoring)
- **Low Risks:** ≤5 (Acceptable with standard controls)

### Risk Thresholds
- **Algorithm Accuracy:** ≥80% validation success rate
- **Performance:** <30 seconds for portfolio assessments
- **Data Quality:** ≥90% completeness for core risk factors
- **Security:** No vulnerabilities in risk data handling

## Recommendations

1. **Implement algorithm validation pipeline** with real historical data
2. **Add performance monitoring** for risk calculation operations
3. **Establish data quality monitoring** with automated alerts
4. **Regular security audits** of risk data handling
5. **Create contingency procedures** for risk assessment failures

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update this risk profile when:
- Algorithm changes are made
- New data sources are integrated
- Performance issues are reported
- Security incidents occur
- User feedback indicates accuracy issues

## Overall Assessment

**Risk Level: LOW**

The risk assessment dashboard implementation has minimal residual risk. All major technical, performance, data, and security risks have been identified and appropriately mitigated. The implementation follows best practices with comprehensive testing, proper error handling, and security measures. The primary remaining risk is algorithm validation with real data, which should be addressed during the initial production deployment phase.
