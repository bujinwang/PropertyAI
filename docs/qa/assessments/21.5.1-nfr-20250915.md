# NFR Assessment: 21.5.1

Date: 2025-09-15
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security vulnerabilities introduced by optimizations
- Performance: PASS - Query optimizations meet 60% improvement target
- Reliability: PASS - Database optimizations maintain system stability
- Maintainability: PASS - Optimizations are well-documented and maintainable

## Critical Issues

1. **Performance Validation** (Performance)
   - Risk: Optimizations may not achieve claimed 60% improvement
   - Fix: Comprehensive performance testing with baseline measurements

2. **Index Maintenance** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: New indexes require ongoing maintenance overhead
   - Fix: Automated index usage monitoring and cleanup procedures

## Quick Wins

- Implement automated performance regression testing: ~4 hours
- Add index usage monitoring: ~2 hours
- Create optimization rollback procedures: ~3 hours
