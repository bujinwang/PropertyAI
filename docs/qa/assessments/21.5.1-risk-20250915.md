Date: 2025-09-15
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 2
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 55/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. DATA-001: Data Integrity During Index Changes

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Index modifications can affect query results and data consistency
**Impact**: High - Could lead to incorrect data being returned or performance degradation
**Mitigation**:

- Comprehensive testing with production data subsets
- Gradual rollout with feature flags for index changes
- Detailed rollback procedures for index modifications
  **Testing Focus**: Data integrity validation before and after index implementation

### 2. PERF-001: Performance Regression from Optimizations

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Query optimizations could introduce new bottlenecks or memory issues
**Impact**: High - Could make system slower than before optimization attempts
**Mitigation**:

- Baseline performance measurements before changes
- A/B testing of optimizations in production
- Real-time performance monitoring during rollout
  **Testing Focus**: Performance regression testing with realistic workloads

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Data integrity testing before and after index changes
- Performance regression testing with baseline comparisons
- Query result validation across different data sets
- Rollback procedure validation for all optimization changes

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Cache invalidation testing with concurrent data updates
- Connection pool stress testing under various loads
- Cache hit/miss ratio validation under realistic scenarios
- Memory usage monitoring during optimization rollout

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Redis failure scenario testing with fallback mechanisms
- Monitoring system performance impact assessment
- Edge case testing for complex query optimizations
- Long-term stability testing of optimization changes

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9) - Data integrity and performance regression
- High risks affecting core functionality (score 6) - Cache invalidation and connection pooling

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls - Cache staleness monitoring
- Low risks with monitoring in place - Redis dependency and monitoring overhead

### Accepted Risks

- Some performance impact from monitoring (acceptable trade-off)
- Minor query optimization edge cases (rare scenarios with fallbacks)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Query performance metrics before and after optimization
- Cache hit rates and invalidation success rates
- Database connection pool utilization and errors
- Data integrity validation through automated checks
- Memory usage and CPU utilization trends

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Database schema changes significantly
- New query patterns emerge from user behavior
- Cache infrastructure experiences outages
- Performance metrics show unexpected changes
- New indexes or optimization techniques are implemented
