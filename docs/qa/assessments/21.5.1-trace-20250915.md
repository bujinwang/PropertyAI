### Critical Gaps

1. **Automated Performance Regression Testing**
   - Gap: No automated system for detecting performance regressions
   - Risk: Medium - Future changes could degrade performance
   - Action: Implement automated performance regression testing

2. **Production Load Testing**
   - Gap: Load testing conducted in staging environment only
   - Risk: Medium - Production environment differences
   - Action: Conduct production load testing with traffic mirroring

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Performance Regression Suite**: Automated testing for query performance baselines
2. **Production Load Testing**: Real production environment testing
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated alerting for performance degradation
4. **Index Maintenance**: Automated index usage analysis and cleanup

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: AC1 and AC2 with comprehensive coverage mitigate data integrity and performance regression risks
- **Medium Risk**: AC3 and AC4 well-covered for caching and connection issues
- **Low Risk**: All acceptance criteria have strong test coverage and risk mitigation
