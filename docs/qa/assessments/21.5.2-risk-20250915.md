## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Cross-Platform Compatibility Issues

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Mobile browsers have different implementations of PWA, camera, and location APIs
**Impact**: High - Could prevent users on certain devices from using core features
**Mitigation**:

- Implement progressive enhancement with feature detection
- Add comprehensive device/browser compatibility testing
- Provide fallback experiences for unsupported features
  **Testing Focus**: Test on iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet with real devices

### 2. DATA-001: Offline Data Synchronization Conflicts

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Complex sync logic prone to race conditions and conflicts
**Impact**: High - Could lead to data loss or corruption during online/offline transitions
**Mitigation**:

- Implement conflict resolution strategies
- Add comprehensive sync testing with network interruptions
- Create data validation before and after sync operations
  **Testing Focus**: Chaos testing with network connectivity changes and concurrent data modifications

### 3. SEC-002: Mobile Permission Security Vulnerabilities

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Camera and location permissions could be exploited if not handled properly
**Impact**: High - Privacy violations and potential security breaches
**Mitigation**:

- Implement secure permission handling with user consent
- Add permission state validation before accessing sensitive APIs
- Encrypt offline data storage
  **Testing Focus**: Security testing for permission bypass scenarios and data exposure

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Cross-platform compatibility testing on iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet
- Offline/online synchronization testing with network interruptions
- Security testing for camera/location permission handling
- Data integrity testing during sync operations

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Performance testing on 2G/3G/4G networks
- Battery usage testing with GPS/camera features active
- Touch gesture testing for conflicts with native browser gestures
- Load testing for offline data storage limits

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for mobile workflows
- Regression testing for existing features
- User acceptance testing with mobile-only users
- Monitoring and alerting validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9) - Cross-platform compatibility, offline sync, permission security
- High risks affecting user experience (score 6) - Network performance, battery usage, gesture conflicts

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls - Storage limitations with user warnings
- Low risks with monitoring in place - Memory usage, inconsistent experiences

### Accepted Risks

- Some performance degradation on very slow networks (2G) - Acceptable for edge cases
- Minor battery impact from background location updates - Users can disable if needed

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Performance metrics for mobile page load times and network conditions
- Security alerts for permission-related security events
- Error rates for offline synchronization and mobile-specific features
- User engagement metrics for mobile vs desktop usage
- Battery usage analytics for GPS/camera features

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New mobile devices or browsers are released
- Offline synchronization issues are reported
- Security vulnerabilities related to mobile permissions are discovered
- Performance issues on specific network conditions are identified
- User feedback indicates mobile experience problems
