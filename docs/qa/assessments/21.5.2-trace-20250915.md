### Critical Gaps

1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Gap: No automated performance regression testing
   - Risk: Medium - Performance degradation could go undetected
   - Action: Implement continuous performance monitoring

2. **Accessibility Automation**
   - Gap: Missing automated accessibility testing tools
   - Risk: Medium - Accessibility issues could be missed
   - Action: Integrate axe-core or similar accessibility testing

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Performance Testing**: Implement automated performance regression testing using Lighthouse CI
2. **Accessibility Testing**: Add automated accessibility testing with axe-core integration
3. **Visual Testing**: Implement visual regression testing for responsive layouts
4. **Load Testing**: Add mobile-specific load testing for concurrent users

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: AC5 (Performance) and AC7 (Accessibility) with partial coverage
- **Medium Risk**: Requirements with good coverage but missing automation
- **Low Risk**: Requirements with comprehensive test coverage across all levels
