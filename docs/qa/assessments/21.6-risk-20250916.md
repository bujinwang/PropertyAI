- Implement performance alerting and monitoring

## Medium Risks (Score 4-5)

### REL-001: Deployment success unconfirmed
**Score: 8 (Medium)**
**Probability:** Low - Infrastructure exists but execution unconfirmed
**Impact:** High - Failed deployment could impact production stability
**Mitigation:**
- Verify actual deployment execution
- Test production functionality
- Validate database migrations and configurations
- Confirm feature flag and rollback functionality

## Low Risks (Score 2-3)

### DOC-001: Missing deployment and monitoring documentation
**Score: 6 (Low)**
**Probability:** Low - Process exists but documentation incomplete
**Impact:** Medium - Future maintenance and troubleshooting hindered
**Mitigation:**
- Create comprehensive deployment documentation
- Document monitoring and alerting procedures
- Establish maintenance and operations runbooks
- Create incident response and troubleshooting guides

## Risk Distribution by Category

- **QA Process:** 1 risk
- **Documentation:** 1 risk

## Mitigation Strategy Summary

### Immediate Actions Required (CRITICAL)
1. **Investigate Production Deployment Status**
   - Confirm if production rollout actually occurred
   - Verify Epic 21 features are deployed and functional
   - Document actual deployment state

2. **Create Production Monitoring Dashboard**
   - `infrastructure/monitoring/dashboards/epic21-dashboard.json`
   - Essential for production visibility and incident response

3. **Conduct Emergency QA Review**
   - Create missing QA assessments and gate file
   - Validate production readiness and functionality

### Monitoring Required
- Production system health and performance
- User impact and feature functionality
- Monitoring and alerting effectiveness
- Deployment and rollback procedure validation

### Contingency Plans
- Emergency rollback procedures if deployment issues discovered
- Alternative monitoring setup if dashboard creation delayed
- Manual production validation if automated checks fail
- Stakeholder communication plan for deployment status

## Risk-Based Testing Recommendations

### Priority 1: Production Validation
- Verify actual production deployment execution
- Test all Epic 21 features in production environment
- Validate monitoring and alerting functionality
- Confirm database migrations and configurations

### Priority 2: System Validation
- Test production performance and scalability
- Validate security and access controls
- Verify backup and recovery procedures
- Test monitoring dashboard functionality

### Priority 3: Process Validation
- Review deployment and monitoring procedures
- Validate incident response capabilities
- Test maintenance and update procedures
- Verify documentation completeness

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Acceptable Risk Levels
- **Critical Risks:** 0 (Zero tolerance - must be resolved immediately)
- **High Risks:** 0 (Must be mitigated before continued production operation)
- **Medium Risks:** ≤1 (Acceptable with monitoring and mitigation)
- **Low Risks:** ≤3 (Acceptable with standard operational procedures)

### Risk Thresholds
- **Deployment Verification:** 100% (Must confirm actual production deployment)
- **Monitoring Coverage:** 100% (Must have working monitoring dashboard)
- **QA Validation:** 100% (Must have QA review and gate approval)
- **Performance Validation:** 95% (Must validate production performance)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Production Audit**
   - Conduct urgent review of production deployment status
   - Verify all Epic 21 features are properly deployed
   - Confirm production environment stability

2. **Critical Infrastructure Creation**
   - Build production monitoring dashboard immediately
   - Implement comprehensive production observability
   - Create incident response and alerting procedures

3. **QA and Validation Process**
   - Execute complete QA review of production deployment
   - Create all missing QA assessments and documentation
   - Validate production readiness and functionality

4. **Process Improvement**
   - Establish production deployment verification procedures
   - Implement automated production validation checks
   - Create comprehensive production operations documentation

5. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Set up production performance monitoring
   - Implement automated alerting for critical issues
   - Create production health dashboards and reports

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update this risk profile when:
- Production deployment status is confirmed
- Monitoring dashboard is created and validated
- QA review is completed
- Production performance is validated
- Documentation is completed
- Any production incidents occur

## Overall Assessment

**Risk Level: CRITICAL**

This represents a critical production risk situation. The story claims successful production rollout with comprehensive monitoring, but essential deliverables are missing and there's no evidence of QA validation. The lack of monitoring dashboard and deployment report creates significant risk for production operations and stability. Immediate investigation and corrective action are required to validate actual production status and implement missing critical infrastructure.
