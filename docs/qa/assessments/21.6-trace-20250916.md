## Story: 21.6 - Production Rollout and Monitoring

### Coverage Summary

- **Total Requirements:** 10
- **Fully Covered:** 0 (0%)
- **Partially Covered:** 3 (30%)
- **Not Covered:** 7 (70%)
- **Evidence:** MOST infrastructure files exist but KEY deliverables missing

## Critical Finding: Major Traceability Gaps

**CRITICAL COMPLIANCE ISSUE:** Story claims successful production rollout but essential deliverables are missing. While infrastructure appears well-implemented, critical validation and documentation gaps create significant production risk.

## Requirement Mappings

### AC1: Production deployment plan created with rollback procedures

**Coverage: 50% - PARTIAL**

**Existing Evidence:**
- `infrastructure/production-deployment.yml` - Deployment configuration exists
- `infrastructure/rollback/production-rollback.sh` - Rollback script exists
- `infrastructure/deploy-epic21.sh` - Deployment script exists

**Missing Evidence:**
- `docs/epic21-production-deployment-report-[timestamp].md` - Actual execution report
- Deployment plan validation documentation
- Execution evidence and results

### AC2: Gradual rollout executed using feature flags (25%, 50%, 100%)

**Coverage: 30% - PARTIAL**

**Existing Evidence:**
- `config/production/feature-flags.yml` - Feature flag configuration exists

**Missing Evidence:**
- Gradual rollout execution logs
- User percentage validation records
- Rollout phase completion documentation
- Feature flag state change records

### AC3: Real-time monitoring configured for all new features

**Coverage: 0% - MISSING**

**Missing Evidence:**
- `infrastructure/monitoring/dashboards/epic21-dashboard.json` - Monitoring dashboard
- Real-time monitoring configuration validation
- Feature-specific monitoring setup
- Monitoring data collection verification

### AC4: Automated alerts set up for performance and error thresholds

**Coverage: 70% - PARTIAL**

**Existing Evidence:**
- `infrastructure/monitoring/production-alerts.yml` - Alert configuration exists
- Alert system appears configured

**Missing Evidence:**
- Alert threshold validation records
- Alert system testing results
- Alert notification delivery verification
- Alert effectiveness monitoring

### AC5: Production database migrations completed successfully

**Coverage: 0% - MISSING**

**Missing Evidence:**
- Database migration execution logs
- Migration success verification records
- Database backup validation
- Post-migration data integrity checks

### AC6: All Epic 21 features verified functional in production

**Coverage: 0% - MISSING**

**Missing Evidence:**
- Production functionality verification reports
- Feature testing results in production
- Integration validation records
- User acceptance validation in production

### AC7: User impact monitored and minimized during rollout

**Coverage: 0% - MISSING**

**Missing Evidence:**
- User impact monitoring setup
- Rollout impact assessment records
- User experience monitoring during rollout
- Impact minimization validation

### AC8: Rollback capability maintained throughout deployment

**Coverage: 80% - PARTIAL**

**Existing Evidence:**
- `infrastructure/rollback/production-rollback.sh` - Rollback script exists
- Rollback infrastructure appears comprehensive

**Missing Evidence:**
- Rollback procedure testing results
- Rollback capability validation during deployment
- Rollback execution readiness verification

### AC9: Post-deployment validation completed

**Coverage: 0% - MISSING**

**Missing Evidence:**
- Post-deployment validation reports
- Production health check results
- System stability validation records
- Performance baseline establishment

### AC10: Production monitoring dashboard updated

**Coverage: 0% - MISSING**

**Missing Evidence:**
- `infrastructure/monitoring/dashboards/epic21-dashboard.json` - Dashboard configuration
- Dashboard functionality validation
- Dashboard data accuracy verification
- Dashboard user acceptance testing

## Critical Gaps Analysis

### Documentation Gap (70% Missing)
- **Impact:** No evidence of actual production deployment execution
- **Risk:** Production rollout may not have occurred or may have failed
- **Status:** CRITICAL - Requires immediate investigation

### Monitoring Gap (100% Missing)
- **Impact:** No production visibility or monitoring capability
- **Risk:** Production issues undetected, no incident response capability
- **Status:** CRITICAL - Essential for production operations

### Validation Gap (100% Missing)
- **Impact:** No verification of production functionality or stability
- **Risk:** Production features may be non-functional or unstable
- **Status:** CRITICAL - Blocks production confidence

## Test Design Recommendations

Based on traceability gaps, recommend:

1. **Immediate Production Audit**
   - Verify actual production deployment execution
   - Validate all Epic 21 features in production
   - Confirm production environment stability

2. **Critical Infrastructure Creation**
   - Create missing monitoring dashboard
   - Implement production monitoring validation
   - Generate production deployment report

3. **Validation Framework Development**
   - Create production testing procedures
   - Implement automated health checks
   - Establish monitoring and alerting validation

## Risk Assessment

- **Critical Risk:** Production deployment execution unconfirmed
- **High Risk:** No production monitoring capability
- **Medium Risk:** Missing validation of production functionality
- **Low Risk:** Incomplete documentation of procedures

## Traceability Best Practices Applied

- **Comprehensive File Audit:** Verified existence of all claimed infrastructure files
- **Execution Evidence Review:** Assessed actual deployment and validation records
- **Gap Documentation:** Clearly identified all missing deliverables and evidence
- **Risk-Based Prioritization:** Focused on critical production operation requirements

## Summary

**Traceability Coverage: 30%**

**MAJOR COMPLIANCE ISSUE:** While infrastructure appears well-implemented with most deployment and monitoring scripts present, critical deliverables are missing that would validate actual production deployment execution. The lack of monitoring dashboard and deployment report creates significant risk for production operations. Immediate investigation required to confirm actual production status and create missing critical documentation.
