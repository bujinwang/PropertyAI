Story: 23.1 - Mobile Dashboard Optimization

## Risk Analysis

### Identified Risks
1. **Browser Compatibility (P0)**
   - Risk: matchMedia/touch events vary across browsers (Safari iOS SW caching limited).
   - Probability: Medium (80% coverage, iOS quirks).
   - Impact: High - offline fails on iOS (no SW support in some contexts).
   - Mitigation: Fallback to localStorage if IndexedDB fails; test on real devices.

2. **Performance Degradation (P1)**
   - Risk: SW caching increases load time if cache bloat; IndexedDB sync conflicts.
   - Probability: Low (basic impl, <3s verified).
   - Impact: Medium - violates AC4.
   - Mitigation: Cache limits in sw.js (max 50 entries); monitor with Lighthouse CI.

3. **Touch Gesture Reliability (P2)**
   - Risk: Swipe threshold 100px too sensitive; false positives on scroll.
   - Probability: Medium (touch events passive false for preventDefault).
   - Impact: Low - console log fallback, no crash.
   - Mitigation: Add debounce, test with Cypress touch simulation.

4. **Accessibility Conflicts (P3)**
   - Risk: Swipe bypasses keyboard nav; ARIA for dynamic classes.
   - Probability: Low (WCAG AA, ARIA on buttons).
   - Impact: Medium - users with disabilities affected.
   - Mitigation: Add keyboard swipe emulation; Axe-core test.

### Risk Matrix
- Total Risks: 4
- Critical: 0
- High: 1 (compatibility)
- Medium: 2 (performance, touch)
- Low: 1 (accessibility)

### Recommendations
- Must Fix: iOS SW polyfill or note limitation.
- Monitor: Cache size in prod; add metrics for SW hits.
- Test: Real device for touch/SW.
