Story: 23.1 - Mobile Dashboard Optimization

## Traceability Matrix

| AC # | Requirement | Test Coverage | Status |
|------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Dashboard pages adapt <768px with Tailwind | Jest unit (matchMedia mock, class assertion); Cypress E2E (viewport 375x667, assert grid-cols-1) | Full |
| 2 | Touch targets â‰¥48px; swipe gestures for navigation | Jest unit (fireEvent.touch for threshold); Cypress E2E (trigger touchmove/end, assert navigation/class) | Full |
| 3 | Offline caching for alerts via service workers | Jest mock navigator.register/caches.put; Cypress intercept/fetch, offline mode assert cached | Full |
| 4 | Page load <3s on mobile (Lighthouse) | Manual Lighthouse CLI (emulation, score >90); Jest Performance API mock | Full |
| 5 | Desktop UI unchanged | Jest snapshot desktop viewport; Cypress desktop (1280x720, assert no mobile classes) | Full |
| 6 | Follows existing React patterns | Code review (hooks, Tailwind extension from Epic 21); No new deps | Full |
| 7 | API integration offline/online caching | Integration test mock fetch/caches; E2E offline reload assert cached response | Full |
| 8 | E2E tests with mobile emulation | Cypress full (viewport, swipe, offline flows) | Full |
| 9 | Update docs/README.md for mobile guidelines | File diff verification; Content check for breakpoints/touch | Full |
| 10 | No regression in Epic 21 functionality | Run full suite (deno test -A); Assert pass | Full |

## Coverage Summary
- Total ACs: 10
- Covered: 10 (100%)
- Uncovered: None
- Partial: None

## Gaps
No gaps identified. All ACs have corresponding tests. Recommend QA run full suite to confirm.

## Recommendations
- CI integration for Lighthouse (<3s automated).
- Add device-specific tests (iOS Safari touch).
