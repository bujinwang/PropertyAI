# Risk Profile: Story 23.2 - Intelligent Alert Grouping

Date: 2025-09-18
Story: 23.2 - Intelligent Alert Grouping

## Risk Analysis

### Identified Risks
1. **DB Performance (P0)**
   - Risk: Group by queries slow for 1000+ alerts without indexes.
   - Probability: Low (migration indexes added).
   - Impact: High - violates AC4.
   - Mitigation: Index verification in test; monitor query time.

2. **Integration Breakage (P1)**
   - Risk: Updating existing components alters alert feeds.
   - Probability: Medium (props unchanged, service wrapper).
   - Impact: Medium - regression in Epic 21.
   - Mitigation: Regression suite run; fallback to direct if service fails.

3. **Filter Logic Errors (P2)**
   - Risk: Client/server filter mismatch; empty groups.
   - Probability: Low (unit tests for applyClientSideFilters).
   - Impact: Low - UI shows no alerts.
   - Mitigation: E2E full flow test.

4. **Pagination Inconsistency (P3)**
   - Risk: Offset/limit skips alerts in groups.
   - Probability: Medium (server-side).
   - Impact: Low - partial data.
   - Mitigation: Integration test with limit.

### Risk Matrix
- Total Risks: 4
- Critical: 0
- High: 1 (DB perf)
- Medium: 2 (integration, pagination)
- Low: 1 (filters)

### Recommendations
- Must Fix: Prod index creation.
- Monitor: Query metrics in prod.
- Test: Stress test with 5000 alerts.
