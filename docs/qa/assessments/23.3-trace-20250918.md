## Traceability Matrix

| AC # | Requirement | Test Coverage | Status |
|------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Template editor drag-drop/save preferences | Jest unit (state toggle, save validation); Cypress E2E (open modal, select, save assert service call) | Full |
| 2 | Apply templates to pages (custom views) | Jest unit (HOC render with layout, fallback); E2E (apply, assert layout renders components) | Full |
| 3 | Export reports PDF/CSV branded | Jest mock export (filename/format); E2E button click, download verification | Full |
| 4 | Role-based sharing | Integration DB mock (role filter, sharedWith); Test shared templates returned | Full |
| 5 | Existing dashboard unchanged no template | Jest unit fallback to children; Regression for dashboard | Full |
| 6 | Follows React patterns | Code review (modal, HOC from existing); No new deps | Full |
| 7 | Integration with data sources | Integration service with mock DB (alerts/predictions) | Full |
| 8 | Unit/E2E tests | Jest for editor/HOC, Cypress full flow | Full |
| 9 | Update docs/epic23/README.md | File diff check for usage | Full |
| 10 | No regression report generation | Run Epic 21 suite, assert pass | Full |
