# Epic 1: Dashboard UI Implementation

## Story 1.1: Implement Core Dashboard Layout & Style

**Status:** Complete

---

## Story

As a Property Manager, I want to see the main dashboard interface implemented according to the UI/UX specification, so that I have a visually consistent and correctly structured starting point for all application features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The main application layout is created, featuring a persistent sidebar for primary navigation.
2.  The color palette, typography, and spacing defined in the UI/UX spec are applied globally.
3.  The Dashboard page (`/`) is created and displays the key elements defined in the wireframes.
4.  The dashboard correctly implements the responsive strategy, with the sidebar collapsing on mobile/tablet.
5.  All initial components use the Material UI library as specified.
6.  The application adheres to the WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standard.

## Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **Setup Global Styles (AC: 2)**
    - [x] Configure the application's theme provider (e.g., in `App.tsx`) to use the specified color palette and typography from the spec.
    - [x] Ensure global CSS resets and base styles are in place.
2.  **Implement Main App Layout (AC: 1, 4)**
    - [x] Create a main layout component that includes a persistent sidebar for navigation.
    - [x] Implement the responsive behavior where the sidebar collapses to a hamburger menu on mobile and tablet breakpoints.
    - [x] Use Material UI components (`Drawer`, `AppBar`, `Toolbar`, etc.) for the layout.
3.  **Create Dashboard Page (AC: 3)**
    - [x] Create the `Dashboard.tsx` page component.
    - [x] Add placeholder components for the key elements: 'Summary of vacant units', 'List of recent maintenance requests', and 'Alerts for overdue payments'.

4.  **Testing (AC: 6)**
    - [x] Write basic unit tests for the new layout and dashboard components.
    - [x] Perform a manual check to ensure the layout is responsive and the sidebar collapses correctly.
