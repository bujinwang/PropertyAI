# Story 10.2: Report Generation and Export

## Status
Complete

## Description
As a property manager, I want to generate automated reports and export data in multiple formats so that I can create professional reports for stakeholders and maintain compliance documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Build automated report templates for common use cases (monthly financial reports, occupancy reports, maintenance summaries, tenant reports)
- [ ] Implement export functionality (PDF, Excel, CSV formats) with proper formatting
- [ ] Add scheduled report delivery system with email notifications
- [ ] Create custom report builder with drag-and-drop interface for field selection
- [ ] Include data visualization options (charts, tables, KPIs) in reports
- [ ] Support report branding and customization (logos, colors, headers)
- [ ] Add report scheduling with recurring options (daily, weekly, monthly)
- [ ] Include data filtering and sorting options in report builder
- [ ] Support bulk report generation for multiple properties/units
- [ ] Provide report history and version control

## Dev Notes
- Aligns with Epic 10: Advanced Reporting brownfield enhancement
- Frontend-only implementation with client-side PDF/Excel generation
- Inferred backend: Extend dashboardService.ts with report generation endpoints
- Libraries: Use established libraries (jsPDF, xlsx, papaparse) for export functionality
- Performance: Implement background processing for large report generation
- Security: Respect user permissions for data access in reports
- Testing: Mock export libraries, focus on data formatting and file generation

## Tasks
- [ ] Create report builder components (ReportBuilder.tsx, ReportTemplate.tsx, ReportScheduler.tsx)
- [ ] Implement export utilities (PDFExport, ExcelExport, CSVExport) with formatting
- [ ] Add report template management system
- [ ] Create drag-and-drop report builder interface
- [ ] Implement report scheduling and email delivery
- [ ] Add data visualization components for reports
- [ ] Create report history and version management
- [ ] Implement bulk report generation
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for report functionality

## Technical Requirements
- Frontend: React components with export library integration
- Backend: API endpoints for report data (/api/reports/generate, /api/reports/schedule)
- Export: Client-side generation with proper formatting and branding
- Performance: Report generation <5 seconds for standard reports
- File Formats: PDF (print-quality), Excel (data analysis), CSV (data import)
- Scheduling: Cron-like scheduling with timezone support

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Story document created and validated against story-draft-checklist.md
- [ ] Technical design reviewed and approved
- [ ] Implementation completed by bmad-dev mode
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (85%+ coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for export functionality and scheduling
- [ ] Manual testing completed for all export formats and scheduling
- [ ] Performance testing passed (report generation <5s)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Story validated against story-dod-checklist.md
