# Story 11.1: Payment Processor Integration

## Status
Complete

## Description
As a property manager, I want to integrate with payment processors so that I can securely collect rent payments, process transactions, and manage recurring payments through the PropertyAI system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integrate with major payment processors (Stripe, PayPal, ACH)
- [ ] Implement secure payment collection with PCI compliance
- [ ] Add recurring payment setup and management (monthly rent, deposits)
- [ ] Include payment reconciliation and transaction reporting
- [ ] Support multiple currencies and international payments
- [ ] Add payment method storage and management (cards, bank accounts)
- [ ] Implement payment status tracking and notifications
- [ ] Include failed payment handling and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Support partial payments and payment plans
- [ ] Add payment history and detailed transaction logs

## Dev Notes
- Aligns with Epic 11: Integration APIs brownfield enhancement
- Frontend-only implementation with secure tokenization
- Inferred backend: Extend dashboardService.ts with payment APIs
- Security: Never store sensitive payment data on frontend
- Libraries: Use established payment SDKs (Stripe Elements, PayPal SDK)
- Testing: Mock payment APIs, focus on UI workflows and error handling
- Compliance: PCI DSS compliance through tokenization and secure iframes

## Tasks
- [ ] Create payment components (PaymentForm.tsx, PaymentMethods.tsx, PaymentHistory.tsx)
- [ ] Implement payment processor integrations (Stripe, PayPal)
- [ ] Add recurring payment setup and management
- [ ] Create payment reconciliation and reporting
- [ ] Implement multi-currency support
- [ ] Add payment method storage and validation
- [ ] Create payment status tracking and notifications
- [ ] Implement failed payment handling and retries
- [ ] Add partial payment and payment plan support
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for payment functionality

## Technical Requirements
- Frontend: React components with payment SDK integration
- Backend: API endpoints for payment processing (/api/payments/process, /api/payments/recurring)
- Security: PCI DSS compliance through tokenization and secure iframes
- Payment Methods: Credit cards, debit cards, ACH, digital wallets
- Currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, CAD with automatic conversion
- Webhooks: Real-time payment status updates and notifications
