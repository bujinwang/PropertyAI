### Offline Storage
- **Database**: SQLite with react-native-sqlite-storage
- **Data Synchronization**: Basic offline queue for API requests
- **Cache Management**: Intelligent caching with TTL
- **Conflict Resolution**: Simple last-write-wins strategy

## üé® **UI/UX Requirements**
- **Design System**: Consistent with web platform Material Design
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes (320px - 414px width)
- **Dark Mode**: System preference detection and support
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with screen reader support
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and progress indicators

## üîí **Security Requirements**
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- **Certificate Pinning**: SSL certificate validation
- **Code Obfuscation**: Production build obfuscation
- **Security Headers**: Proper security headers for API requests

## üß™ **Testing Requirements**
- **Unit Tests**: Jest with React Native Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: API integration and navigation flow tests
- **E2E Tests**: Detox for critical user flows
- **Device Testing**: iOS Simulator and Android Emulator testing
