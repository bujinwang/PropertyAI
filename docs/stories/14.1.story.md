- [ ] Security policies for password complexity and account lockout
- [ ] Mobile app authentication integration
- [ ] Single sign-on (SSO) capability for enterprise customers
- [ ] Biometric authentication support (fingerprint, face ID)
- [ ] Audit logging for all authentication events
- [ ] Security dashboard for monitoring authentication attempts

## 🔧 **Technical Requirements**
- **Frontend**: React components for MFA setup, biometric auth, security settings
- **Backend**: Enhanced authentication service with MFA support, RBAC middleware
- **Database**: User sessions table, audit logs, security settings
- **Mobile**: Native biometric authentication integration
- **Security**: OWASP compliance, secure token storage, encryption

## 🧪 **Testing Requirements**

- **Session Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable thresholds without false positives

## 🔒 **Security Requirements**
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- **Token Security**: Secure JWT with proper expiration and refresh
- **Brute Force Protection**: Account lockout after failed attempts
- **Session Security**: Secure session cookies with HttpOnly and Secure flags
- [ ] GDPR compliance for user data handling
- [ ] CCPA compliance for California residents
- [ ] SOX compliance for financial data access

## 📱 **Mobile Integration**
- [ ] Native biometric authentication (Touch ID, Face ID)
- [ ] Secure token storage in mobile keychain
- [ ] Offline authentication capability
- [ ] Push notifications for security events

## 🚀 **Implementation Plan**
1. **Phase 1**: Core authentication enhancements (MFA, RBAC)
2. **Phase 2**: Mobile integration and biometric auth
3. **Phase 3**: Enterprise features (SSO, advanced policies)
4. **Phase 4**: Security monitoring and alerting

## 📈 **Success Metrics**
- **Security Score**: 95%+ security rating improvement
- **User Adoption**: 90%+ MFA adoption within 30 days
- **Performance**: <5% authentication overhead
- **Incident Rate**: 0 security incidents related to authentication

## 🔗 **Dependencies**

- Notification system (Epic 8)
- Mobile app infrastructure (Epic 12)

## 📅 **Timeline**
- **Development**: 2 weeks
- **Testing**: 1 week
- **Total**: 3 weeks

## 👥 **Stakeholders**
- **Security Team**: Security architecture and implementation
- **Development Team**: Feature implementation
- **QA Team**: Security testing and validation
- **Property Managers**: Enhanced security for their operations
- **Tenants**: Secure access to their accounts

## 📋 **Definition of Done**
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Security audit passed with zero critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance benchmarks achieved
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed (95% satisfaction)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Automated tests passing (85%+ coverage)
- [ ] Mobile app integration tested
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified

## 🏷️ **Labels**
- Priority: High
- Type: Security Enhancement
- Platform: Web, Mobile
- Compliance: GDPR, CCPA, SOX

## 📝 **Notes**
- Brownfield enhancement - must maintain backward compatibility
- Security features should be configurable for different user tiers
- Consider enterprise customers requiring SSO integration
- Mobile biometric auth should work offline when possible

## 🛠️ **Dev Agent Record**

### **Implementation Summary**
Successfully implemented enterprise-grade authentication and authorization features with comprehensive security enhancements.
