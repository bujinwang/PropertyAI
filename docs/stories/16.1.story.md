# Story 16.1: Automated Approval Workflows

## üìä **Status**
Ready for Review

## üéØ **Objective**
Implement an intelligent approval workflow system that automates the routing, approval, and tracking of property management requests and decisions.

## üìã **Description**
This story focuses on creating a comprehensive approval workflow engine that intelligently routes requests based on type, amount, risk level, and organizational hierarchy. Property managers will be able to configure approval chains, set automated rules, and track the progress of all approval processes in real-time.

## üìù **Dev Notes**
- **Epic Alignment**: Supports Epic 16 (Advanced Workflow Automation) by providing the approval workflow foundation
- **Technical Inference**: Extends existing Prisma schema with ApprovalWorkflow, ApprovalStep, ApprovalInstance, ApprovalAction models; follows User/Role relationship patterns from prior epics
- **UI Patterns**: Reuses Material UI components and responsive design from existing dashboard patterns
- **Constraints**: Brownfield enhancement - no breaking changes to existing user management or notification systems
- **Testing**: Unit tests for workflow engine, integration tests for approval flows, performance tests for concurrent approvals
- **Dependencies**: Requires existing user management, role-based access control, and notification systems

## ‚úÖ **Tasks**
- [x] Create approval workflow engine and routing logic
- [x] Extend Prisma schema with approval workflow models
- [x] Implement automated rules engine for approval decisions
- [x] Create workflow designer UI components
- [x] Add approval dashboard and tracking interfaces
- [x] Implement delegation and escalation mechanisms
- [x] Create comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, performance)
- [x] Update documentation and API references
