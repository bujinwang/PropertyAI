## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

**Current Data Sources:**
- Property Management (Epic 2): Property details, unit configurations, location data
- Tenant Management (Epic 3): Tenant profiles, payment history, lease compliance
- Lease Management (Epic 4): Lease terms, renewal patterns, rent pricing history
- Maintenance Tracking (Epic 5): Maintenance history, cost patterns, equipment failure data
- Financial Management (Epic 6): Revenue streams, expense patterns, profitability metrics
- Workflow Automation (Epic 16): Process efficiency data, approval patterns

**Existing Technology Stack:**
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Node.js backend with TypeScript
- React frontend with Material-UI
- Existing API patterns and authentication

### Integration Approach

**Database Extensions:**
