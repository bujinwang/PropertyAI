# Story 18.1: AI Matching Engine Implementation

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a property manager,
I want an AI matching engine that intelligently pairs tenants with properties,
So that I can reduce vacancy periods by 30% and improve tenant-property fit for better retention and revenue optimization.

## Context Source

- Source Document: docs/prd/epic-18.md (AI-Powered Property Matching and Tenant Screening Marketplace)
- Enhancement Type: Brownfield - Adding AI matching to existing tenant/property services
- Existing System Impact: Integrates with Tenant Management (Epic 3), Property Management (Epic 2), and Analytics Engine (Epic 17)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Tenant Profile Scoring**: Generate comprehensive tenant scores based on financial stability, preferences, history, and behavior patterns.
2. **Property Suitability Analysis**: Evaluate properties against tenant criteria including amenities, location, pricing, and availability.
3. **Matching Algorithm**: Implement ML-based matching with multi-factor scoring and ranking of potential matches.
4. **Owner Preference Integration**: Allow owners to customize matching filters and weighting for their specific criteria.
5. **Recommendation Engine**: Provide explainable recommendations with confidence scores and reasons.

### Non-Functional Requirements

6. **Performance**: Match generation <5 seconds for 100+ properties.
7. **Bias Mitigation**: Demographic parity <2% in matching outcomes.
8. **API Endpoints**: Secure REST endpoints for matching, scoring, A/B testing.
9. **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with appropriate HTTP codes.
10. **Scalability**: Handle 1000+ concurrent requests without degradation.
11. **Security**: No PII in ML vectors; audit logs for matches.
12. **Audit Logging**: Log all matching decisions for compliance.
13. **Load Testing**: Verified scalability for production loads.
