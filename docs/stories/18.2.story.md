# Story 18.2: Automated Tenant Screening System

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a property manager,
I want an automated tenant screening system with AI risk assessment,
So that I can quickly evaluate applicant quality, reduce bad tenant risks, and streamline the approval process while ensuring fair housing compliance.

## Context Source

- Source Document: docs/prd/epic-18.md (AI-Powered Property Matching and Tenant Screening Marketplace)
- Enhancement Type: Brownfield - Adding screening workflow to existing tenant onboarding
- Existing System Impact: Integrates with Tenant Management (Epic 3), Financial Management (Epic 6), and marketplace matching (Story 18.1)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Credit Check Integration**: Automatic credit report retrieval and scoring from third-party services.
2. **Background Check Automation**: Comprehensive criminal, eviction, and employment verification.
3. **AI Risk Assessment**: ML-based risk scoring combining screening data with tenant history and matching score from 18.1.
4. **Reference Verification**: Automated contact and validation of previous landlords/employers.
5. **Red Flag Detection**: AI identification of high-risk applicants with escalation to owners.
6. **Screening Report Generation**: Comprehensive PDF report with scores, risks, and recommendations.

### Integration Requirements

7. **Third-Party API Integration**: Seamless connection to Checkr, TransUnion, and reference services.
8. **Real-time Processing**: Screening results available <30 seconds for most applicants.
9. **Workflow Integration**: Automatic triggering from marketplace applications (18.3).
10. **Existing Onboarding**: Current tenant application process continues unchanged for non-marketplace.
11. **Data Privacy**: GDPR/CCPA compliant handling of sensitive screening data.

### Quality Requirements

12. **Accuracy**: 85%+ accuracy in risk predictions validated against historical tenant performance.
13. **Scalability**: Support 500+ screenings per day with API rate limiting.
14. **Compliance**: Fair housing audits and bias detection in screening algorithms.
15. **Security**: Encrypted storage and transmission of screening data.
16. **Test Coverage**: 85%+ for screening logic and API integrations.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights

Story 18.1 matching engine provides tenant scores; reuse for risk assessment input. Ensure matching data flows to screening without PII exposure.

### Data Models

[Source: docs/architecture/epic-18.md#Data Models]

- **Tenant Model Extension**: Add screeningStatus, riskScore, screeningReportId (extend src/models/Tenant.js).
- **New Model**: ScreeningReport (id, tenantId, creditScore, backgroundResults, referenceVerification, riskLevel, aiAssessment, status: 'pending'|'completed'|'failed') – create src/models/ScreeningReport.js.
- **New Model**: ScreeningLog (id, reportId, checkType, result, timestamp) – for audit trail.
- Fields: creditScore (0-850), riskLevel ('low'|'medium'|'high'), aiAssessment (explanation string).

### API Specifications

[Source: docs/architecture/epic-18.md#API Specifications]

- **New Endpoints**:
  - POST /api/marketplace/screen – Input: {tenantId, applicationId}; Output: screening request ID.
  - GET /api/marketplace/screen/{id} – Retrieve screening status/results.
  - POST /api/marketplace/screen/verify-reference – Automated reference check.
  - GET /api/marketplace/screen/report/{tenantId} – Generate/download report.
- Auth: JWT with 'run_screening' permission; rate limit 10/min per tenant.
- External: Checkr API for background, TransUnion for credit – mock for dev.

### Component Specifications

[Source: docs/architecture/epic-18.md#Key Modules]

- **Backend Service**: Extend marketplaceService.js with screening orchestration; new screeningWorkflow.js for async processing.
- **Integrations**: Use axios for API calls; add retry logic with exponential backoff.
- **Frontend**: No UI in this story; API for 18.3 workflow.
- **File Locations**: backend/src/services/screeningWorkflow.js (new), update marketplaceService.js; src/models/ScreeningReport.js (new).

### Testing Requirements

[Source: core-config.yaml devLoadAlwaysFiles docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Unit tests for risk scoring and report generation.
- Integration tests with mock third-party APIs (nock).
- Performance tests for <30s processing.
- Security tests for data encryption and consent.

### Technical Constraints

[Source: docs/prd/epic-18.md#Technical Requirements]

- Performance: <30s screening; use async PubSub for long-running checks.
- Security: Encrypt PII in transit/storage; consent checks before screening.
- Compliance: Log all decisions; bias detection in AI assessment.
- Scalability: Queue heavy checks (background) via existing PubSub.

### Project Structure Notes

[Source: docs/architecture/epic-18.md#Project Structure]

- Aligns with existing; new models/services in standard locations.
- No conflicts; additive to tenant model.
