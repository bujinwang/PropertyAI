# Story 19.1: Stripe Integration and Payment Setup

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a property owner,
I want to integrate Stripe for secure payment processing,
so that tenants can safely save payment methods and I can process rent payments securely.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Stripe SDK integrated with proper API key configuration
2. Tenant model extended with payment method storage (Stripe customer ID, payment method IDs)
3. POST /api/payments/setup-customer endpoint creates Stripe customer and returns client secret
4. POST /api/payments/setup-payment-method endpoint saves payment method for tenant
5. GET /api/payments/payment-methods endpoint retrieves saved payment methods for tenant
6. DELETE /api/payments/payment-methods/:id endpoint removes payment method
7. Role-based access: tenants can only manage their own payment methods, owners/managers can view all
8. PCI DSS compliance maintained through Stripe's hosted fields
9. Error handling for Stripe API failures with appropriate user messages
10. No sensitive payment data stored in application database

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:** N/A (first story in Epic 19).

**Data Models:** Extend Tenant model with stripeCustomerId (string), add PaymentMethod model with tenantId, stripePaymentMethodId, type (card/ach), last4, brand, isDefault [Source: architecture/data-models.md].

**API Specifications:** All endpoints require JWT auth, return standardized response format with success/error fields; use Stripe webhooks for async updates [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md].

**Component Specifications:** Add PaymentSetup component with Stripe Elements for secure form collection; PaymentMethodsList for managing saved methods [Source: architecture/components.md].

**File Locations:** New: src/services/stripeService.js, src/routes/payments.js; Extend: src/models/Tenant.js, src/models/PaymentMethod.js; Frontend: dashboard/src/components/PaymentSetup.tsx, dashboard/src/services/paymentService.ts.

**Testing Requirements:** Unit tests for service functions with mocked Stripe API, integration tests for endpoints, RTL for components with mocked Stripe Elements [Source: testing-strategy.md].

**Technical Constraints:** Use Stripe Node.js SDK v12+, implement webhook signature verification, handle rate limiting, comply with Stripe's terms of service.
