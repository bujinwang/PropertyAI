# Epic 2: Property Listing Management

## Story 2.2: Property-Unit Association Management

**Status:** Complete

---

## Story

As a Property Manager, I want to manage unit associations within property listings, so that I can handle multi-unit properties with individual unit details like occupancy, rent, and maintenance.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Ability to add, edit, and delete units associated with a property from the property detail view.
2. List view for units per property, showing details (number, type, occupancy status, rent amount).
3. Bulk operations: Add multiple units at once, assign tenants to units.
4. Operations integrate with backend APIs for unit CRUD, updating property totals.
5. UI responsive, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA), Material UI consistent.
6. Validation for unit data (e.g., unique unit numbers, rent > 0); error handling.

## Dev Notes

**CRITICAL:** No formal architecture documents found. Guidance from Epic 2, previous stories, project structure.

- **Previous Story Insights:** From Story 2.1: Property CRUD established. Extend Property detail page with units tab/section. Use existing navigation.
- **Data Models:** [Source: backend/prisma/schema.prisma] Use Unit model (propertyId FK, unitNumber, type, occupancy, rent, etc.). Relations to Property.
- **API Specifications:** [Source: Inferred from backend] Extend /api/units for GET/POST/PUT/DELETE with propertyId filter. Auth required.
- **Component Specifications:** [Source: dashboard/src and Material UI]
    - Units List: Table or List with expandable rows.
    - Unit Form: Modal with fields for unit details.
    - Bulk Add: Dialog with repeatable form sections.
- **File Locations:** [Source: dashboard/ directory]
    - Update PropertyList.tsx to link to property detail with units.
    - Create dashboard/src/pages/PropertyDetail.tsx, UnitForm.tsx, UnitsList.tsx.
    - Services: Add unit methods to dashboard/src/services/dashboardService.ts.
- **Testing Requirements:** [Source: Inferred]
    - Unit tests for forms and lists.
    - Integration tests for association APIs.
    - Accessibility and responsiveness checks.
- **Technical Constraints:**
    - Material UI v5+.
    - WCAG 2.1 AA.
    - Handle large unit lists with virtualization if needed.

**Project Structure Notes:** Extend pages/components; ensure relation queries optimized.
