# Story 20.1: Analytics Dashboard Foundation

## Status: Done

## Story

As a property owner or manager,
I want a foundational analytics dashboard displaying core performance metrics,
so that I can quickly assess the health and efficiency of my rental portfolio.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dashboard displays key metrics: occupancy rate, total revenue (last 30 days), average rent, number of active tenants.
2. Metrics are aggregated from Tenant, Property, Invoice, and Payment models.
3. Data is filtered by date range (default: last 30 days) and property selection (all or specific).
4. Metrics load within 3 seconds for up to 100 properties.
5. Role-based access: Owners see portfolio-wide, Managers see property-specific.
6. Existing dashboard navigation integrates seamlessly (new "Analytics" tab).
7. No impact on existing payment or screening workflows.
8. Metrics accuracy validated against raw data (e.g., revenue = sum of paid invoices).

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:** N/A (first story in Epic 20).

**Data Models:** Use existing Sequelize models: Tenant (occupancy count), Property (portfolio aggregation), Invoice/Payment (revenue calc via sum(status='paid').amount). Add indexes if needed for queries [Source: architecture/data-models.md].

**API Specifications:** Extend GET /api/analytics/metrics – Query params: dateFrom, dateTo, propertyIds; Auth: JWT with role check; Returns: {occupancyRate: number, totalRevenue: number, avgRent: number, activeTenants: number} [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md].

**Component Specifications:** MUI Cards for metrics display, DatePicker for range, MultiSelect for properties. Use Recharts for simple bar/line previews if trends added later [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md].

**File Locations:** New route: src/routes/analytics.js; New service: src/services/analyticsService.js; Frontend: dashboard/src/components/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx, integrate into Dashboard.tsx as new tab.

**Testing Requirements:** Unit tests for service aggregations (mock DB), integration for API (nock Stripe if payments involved), RTL for component render/filters [Source: testing-strategy.md].

**Technical Constraints:** Queries <500ms, use pagination for large datasets; no schema changes, read-only aggregations.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Implement analytics service (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create src/services/analyticsService.js with getMetrics function (aggregate from models).
  - [x] Add unit tests for calculations (e.g., occupancy = activeTenants / totalUnits).
  - [x] Optimize queries with Sequelize includes/where.

- [x] Task 2: Add API route (AC: 2, 3, 5)
  - [x] Extend src/routes/analytics.js with GET /metrics.
  - [x] Add role-based filtering (Owner: all, Manager: assigned properties).
  - [x] Integration tests for API responses (mock service).

- [x] Task 3: Frontend dashboard component (AC: 1, 3, 4, 6)
  - [x] Create AnalyticsDashboard.tsx with MUI Grid/Cards for metrics.
  - [x] Integrate React Query for data fetching with filters.
  - [x] RTL tests for render, filter application, loading states.

- [x] Task 4: Integrate into main dashboard (AC: 6)
  - [x] Add "Analytics" tab to Dashboard.tsx.
  - [x] Verify no UI regressions (snapshot tests).
  - [x] Performance test: Load time <3s.

- [x] Task 5: Verify existing functionality (AC: 7)
  - [x] Run full test suite to confirm no regressions.
  - [x] Manual check: Payments and screening still work.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-14

### Reviewed By: James (Full Stack Developer)

### Code Quality Assessment

The Analytics Dashboard Foundation implementation demonstrates excellent code quality with proper separation of concerns. The analytics service provides clean, efficient data aggregation from existing models without schema changes. The API routes are well-structured with proper authentication and error handling. The React frontend follows Material-UI patterns and includes proper loading states and error handling.

### Refactoring Performed

None - the implementation is well-architected and follows best practices.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Clean, readable code with proper error handling
- Project Structure: ✓ Services, routes, and components properly organized
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests for service logic, integration tests for API
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria validated through code review and test analysis

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Consider adding caching for frequently accessed metrics
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for query execution times
- [ ] Consider adding export functionality for raw metrics data

### Security Review

No security concerns found. API routes use proper JWT authentication, role-based filtering prevents unauthorized data access, no sensitive data exposure in metrics.

### Performance Considerations

Performance requirements met with <3s load times for 100 properties. Queries are optimized with proper indexing and aggregation. No obvious bottlenecks in the current implementation.

### Files Modified During Review

None
