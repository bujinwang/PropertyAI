# Story 20.3: Export and Compliance Features

## Status: Done

## Story

As a property owner or manager,
I want export capabilities for reports and compliance documents,
so that I can generate PDF/CSV files for financial summaries, tax reporting, and audits, ensuring regulatory compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Export dashboard data as PDF (full page layout with charts/metrics) and CSV (raw data tables).
2. Pre-built compliance templates: Tax summary (yearly revenue/expenses), Audit trail (payment history).
3. Exports include filters applied (date range, property selection).
4. Scheduled exports via email (weekly/monthly, integrate with notificationService).
5. Exports secure: Role-based (managers export property-specific), no sensitive data (PII redacted).
6. Generation <10s, file size <5MB for 100 properties.
7. No impact on dashboard performance.
8. Exports validated against standards (e.g., GAAP for financials).

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:** Builds on 20.2 custom layouts; export from current view. Use pdf-lib for PDF, csv-writer for CSV.

**Data Models:** Aggregate from existing models; no new fields, use Invoice/Payment for financials [Source: architecture/data-models.md].

**API Specifications:** POST /api/analytics/export â€“ Body: {format: 'pdf|csv', template: 'tax|audit', filters: {...}}; Returns: file download URL or base64; Auth: JWT [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md].

**Component Specifications:** Add ExportButton in AnalyticsDashboard; Modal for template selection; Progress indicator for generation [Source: architecture/components.md].

**File Locations:** Extend analyticsService.js (add exportData); New: src/utils/exportService.js; Frontend: dashboard/src/components/ExportModal.tsx; Update routes/analytics.js.

**Testing Requirements:** Unit for export logic (mock fs), integration for API/file gen, RTL for button/modal [Source: testing-strategy.md].

**Technical Constraints:** Async generation (queue if large), secure temp files; comply with data export limits (e.g., 1 year max).
