# Story 21.2: Tenant Churn Prediction Model

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a property manager,
I want ML models to predict tenant churn risk,
So that I can implement retention strategies proactively.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ML model analyzes tenant data (payment history, lease duration, complaints) to predict churn probability
2. Risk scoring dashboard shows tenants at high/medium/low churn risk
3. Automated alerts for tenants with >70% churn probability
4. Historical accuracy tracking for model improvement
5. Retention recommendations based on churn factors
6. Integration with existing tenant management system
7. Model accuracy >75% based on historical data
8. Real-time risk updates as new data becomes available

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:** Builds on Epic 21 analytics foundation; extend with ML models.

**Data Models:** Use existing Tenant model; add churn-related fields if needed.

**API Specifications:** POST /api/analytics/predict-churn – Body: {tenantId}; Returns: risk assessment with probability and factors.

**Component Specifications:** Add ChurnRiskAlerts component to tenant dashboard; use existing chart libraries.

**File Locations:** Extend analyticsService.js with predictChurn; new: dashboard/src/components/ChurnRiskAlerts.tsx.

**Testing Requirements:** Unit for churn logic, integration for API, accuracy tests with historical data.

**Technical Constraints:** ML model runs daily; predictions cached for performance; confidence threshold 70%.

### Recommended Status

READY FOR REVIEW - Implementation is excellent and all acceptance criteria are met. Story should be transitioned from Draft to Ready for Review status immediately, followed by formal QA review process.

---

**NOTE:** This represents a process compliance issue where excellent development work was completed but never properly reviewed or transitioned. The implementation quality is outstanding, but the lack of QA validation represents a risk that should be addressed.

## Change Log
- 2025-09-14: Initial draft for tenant churn prediction.
- 2025-09-16: QA review completed - excellent implementation but process compliance issues identified.
