# Story 21.4: Staging Environment Validation

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a deployment engineer,
I want to deploy and validate all Epic 21 features in staging environment with comprehensive testing,
So that I can ensure the features work correctly before production deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All 5 Epic 21 features (Predictive Maintenance, Tenant Churn Prediction, Market Trend Integration, AI-Powered Reporting, Risk Assessment Dashboard) deploy successfully to staging
2. Database migrations run without errors and data integrity is maintained
3. All new API endpoints respond correctly with proper authentication
4. Frontend components load and function properly in staging environment
5. Existing staging functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New functionality follows existing deployment patterns
7. Integration with existing staging infrastructure maintains current behavior
8. Change is covered by deployment and integration tests
9. No regression in existing staging functionality verified

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:** Epic 21 features are complete and tested; this validates deployment readiness.

**Data Models:** Use existing Property/Tenant/MaintenanceHistory models with new market metrics.

**API Specifications:** All Epic 21 endpoints must be accessible and functional in staging.

**Component Specifications:** All new React components must render correctly in staging.

**File Locations:** Deploy using existing infrastructure/terraform files and CI/CD pipeline.

**Testing Requirements:** Integration tests for all new endpoints, component tests for UI, deployment verification tests.

**Technical Constraints:** Staging must mirror production environment, no external API calls in staging (use mocks), maintain performance SLAs.
