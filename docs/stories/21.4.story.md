# Story 21.4: AI-Powered Reporting Engine

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a property manager or executive stakeholder,
I want to receive automated, AI-generated reports with predictive insights and actionable recommendations,
So that I can make data-driven decisions quickly without manual analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. AI-generated executive summaries for monthly/quarterly property performance
2. Automated insight generation from multiple data sources (maintenance, tenant, market, financial)
3. Predictive elements integrated into reports (churn risk, maintenance forecasts, market trends)
4. Custom report templates with configurable sections and visualizations
5. Actionable recommendations with priority scoring and implementation guidance
6. Scheduled report delivery via email and dashboard access
7. Report export capabilities (PDF, CSV, Excel formats)
8. Audit trail for AI-generated insights and decision recommendations

## Dev Notes

Based on Epic 21 requirements and existing architecture:

### Technical Context
- Extend analyticsService.js with AI reporting capabilities
- Integrate with existing predictive models (churn, maintenance, market)
- Use existing notification service for report delivery
- Follow dashboard patterns for report UI components
- Leverage current authentication and authorization

### Previous Story Insights
- From 21.3: Market data integration provides real-time trends for financial reports
- From 21.2: Churn prediction models can feed into retention-focused reports
- From 21.1: Maintenance predictions integrate into operational reports

### Data Models
- New ReportTemplate model for custom report configurations
- New GeneratedReport model for storing and tracking reports
- Extend existing analytics models with report metadata
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#reporting-extensions]

### API Specifications
- POST /reports/generate - Generate custom report
- GET /reports/scheduled - List scheduled reports
- POST /reports/schedule - Create report schedule
- GET /reports/{id} - Retrieve specific report
- POST /reports/{id}/export - Export report in specified format
[Source: docs/architecture/rest-api-spec.md#reporting-endpoints]

### Component Specifications
- ReportDashboard: Main reporting interface with template management
- ReportPreview: Live preview of report configurations
- InsightGenerator: AI-powered content generation component
- ReportScheduler: Scheduling and delivery configuration

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for AI insight generation and natural language processing
- Integration tests for report generation pipeline
- E2E tests for complete report creation and delivery workflow
- Performance tests for large dataset report generation
- Security tests for report access control and data privacy
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#reporting-testing]

### Technical Constraints
- AI-generated content must include confidence scores and sources
- Reports containing sensitive data require additional approval workflows
- Report generation should complete within 30 seconds for standard reports
- All AI recommendations must be auditable and traceable to data sources
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#ai-reporting]

## Testing

- Unit tests for AI insight generation and report templating
- Integration tests for report generation pipeline
- Component tests for reporting UI components
- End-to-end tests for complete reporting workflow
- Performance tests for large report generation
- Security tests for report access and data privacy
