# Story: Epic 21.5.1 - Database Query Optimization

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a PropertyAI user, I want faster dashboard loading times so that I can work more efficiently and make timely decisions.

## Context

**Performance Issue Identified:**
User feedback analysis shows that 27% of performance complaints are related to slow dashboard loading times. Current average load time is ~3.5 seconds, with target of <2 seconds.

**Technical Context:**
- PostgreSQL database with Sequelize ORM
- Complex queries for property data, market trends, and AI predictions
- Multiple JOIN operations across related tables
- Lack of proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- No query result caching mechanism

**Business Impact:**
- Reduced user productivity and satisfaction
- Increased support ticket volume for performance issues
- Potential user churn due to poor experience
- Competitive disadvantage vs faster platforms

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Query Performance Improvement**
   - Reduce average dashboard query time by 60% (from ~800ms to <320ms)
   - Implement proper database indexing on all frequently queried columns
   - Optimize complex JOIN operations with proper execution plans
   - Add query result caching for repeated dashboard queries

2. **Database Optimization**
   - Analyze and optimize slow queries using EXPLAIN ANALYZE
   - Implement composite indexes for multi-column WHERE clauses
   - Add partial indexes for frequently filtered data
   - Optimize table structure and relationships

3. **Caching Implementation**
   - Implement Redis-based query result caching
   - Set appropriate TTL values based on data freshness requirements

4. **Connection Pooling**
   - Implement connection pooling to reduce connection overhead
   - Configure optimal pool size based on concurrent user load

5. **Performance Targets**
   - Dashboard load time: <2 seconds (40% improvement)
   - API response time: <500ms for 95% of requests

7. **Scalability**
   - Support 2x current concurrent user load
   - Maintain performance under peak load conditions
   - Implement read replicas for query distribution
   - Add database connection limits and throttling

### Quality Requirements
8. **Testing**
   - Load testing with realistic user scenarios
   - Query performance regression testing
   - Cache hit rate validation (>80% for repeated queries)
   - Database connection pool stress testing

9. **Documentation**
   - Update database schema documentation
   - Document indexing strategy and rationale
   - Create query optimization guidelines
   - Document caching implementation and TTL policies

## Dev Notes

### Current Database Schema Analysis
- **Properties table:** 50K+ records, frequently queried by location, status, type
- **MarketData table:** Time-series data with complex aggregations
- **MaintenanceHistory table:** Large dataset with date-based filtering
- **TenantData table:** Complex relationships with properties and leases

### Required Indexes (Priority Order)
1. **High Priority:**
   - Properties: (location, property_type, status)
   - Properties: (created_at, updated_at)
   - MarketData: (property_id, date, metric_type)
   - MaintenanceHistory: (property_id, maintenance_type, scheduled_date)

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Composite indexes for dashboard queries
   - Partial indexes for active records only
   - Foreign key indexes for JOIN optimization

### Caching Strategy
- **Query Result Cache:** Redis with 5-minute TTL for dashboard data
- **API Response Cache:** 1-minute TTL for frequently requested data
- **Static Data Cache:** 1-hour TTL for reference data (property types, statuses)
- **User Session Cache:** 30-minute TTL for personalized data

### Implementation Approach
1. **Phase 1:** Index analysis and creation (minimal risk)
2. **Phase 2:** Query optimization and caching (moderate risk)
3. **Phase 3:** Connection pooling and monitoring (low risk)
4. **Phase 4:** Performance testing and validation (no risk)

### Risk Mitigation
- **Gradual Rollout:** Implement changes in production with feature flags
- **Rollback Plan:** Ability to disable caching and revert indexes
- **Monitoring:** Real-time performance monitoring during rollout
- **Testing:** Comprehensive load testing before production deployment
