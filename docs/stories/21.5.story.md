# Story 21.5: Risk Assessment Dashboard

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a property owner,
I want a comprehensive risk assessment dashboard,
So that I can monitor portfolio-wide risks and implement proactive mitigation strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Comprehensive risk scoring for all properties and tenants in portfolio
2. Real-time risk visualization with color-coded severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. Portfolio-wide risk aggregation showing overall risk exposure
4. Individual risk factor analysis with trend tracking over time
5. Automated risk alerts for critical and high-risk situations
6. Mitigation strategy recommendations for each risk category
7. Historical risk trend analysis with predictive risk forecasting
8. Risk scoring algorithm with >80% accuracy based on historical data
9. Integration with existing property and tenant management systems
10. Export capabilities for risk reports and compliance documentation

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:** Builds on Epic 21 analytics foundation; integrates with Stories 21.1-21.4 for comprehensive risk assessment.

**Data Models:** Extend existing Property and Tenant models with risk-related fields; create RiskAssessment and RiskFactor models.

**API Specifications:**
- GET /api/risks/portfolio - Returns portfolio-wide risk summary
- GET /api/risks/property/:id - Returns property-specific risk assessment
- GET /api/risks/tenant/:id - Returns tenant-specific risk assessment
- POST /api/risks/assess - Triggers comprehensive risk assessment
- GET /api/risks/trends - Returns historical risk trends

**Component Specifications:** Create RiskAssessmentDashboard component with risk heatmaps, trend charts, and mitigation recommendations.

**File Locations:**
- Backend: src/services/riskAssessmentService.js, src/routes/risks.js
- Frontend: dashboard/src/components/RiskAssessmentDashboard.tsx
- Models: src/models/RiskAssessment.js, src/models/RiskFactor.js

**Testing Requirements:** Unit tests for risk algorithms, integration tests for API, accuracy validation with historical data.

**Technical Constraints:** Risk assessment runs hourly; results cached for performance; real-time updates for critical risks.

## Risk Assessment Categories

### Property Risks
- **Maintenance Risk**: Based on predictive maintenance data from Story 21.1
- **Market Risk**: Based on market trend analysis from Story 21.3
- **Financial Risk**: Revenue stability, expense trends, cash flow analysis
- **Operational Risk**: Management efficiency, tenant turnover, vacancy rates
- **Compliance Risk**: Regulatory compliance, insurance coverage, legal issues

### Tenant Risks
- **Churn Risk**: Based on churn prediction from Story 21.2
- **Payment Risk**: Payment history, late payments, default probability
- **Behavioral Risk**: Complaint frequency, lease violations, property damage
- **Financial Risk**: Income stability, credit score trends, employment status
- **Satisfaction Risk**: Survey responses, renewal likelihood, recommendation scores

### Portfolio Risks
- **Concentration Risk**: Over-reliance on specific property types or locations
- **Market Risk**: Geographic market concentration and economic dependencies
- **Operational Risk**: Management capacity and resource allocation
- **Financial Risk**: Debt structure, interest rate exposure, liquidity position

## Risk Scoring Methodology

### Risk Score Calculation
```
Risk Score = (Impact × Probability) × Confidence
Where:
- Impact: 1-5 scale (1 = Minimal, 5 = Critical)
- Probability: 0-1 scale (0 = Impossible, 1 = Certain)
- Confidence: 0-1 scale (based on data quality and algorithm accuracy)
```

### Risk Level Classification
- **Critical (4.0-5.0)**: Immediate action required, potential for significant loss
- **High (3.0-3.9)**: Urgent attention needed, moderate to high risk
- **Medium (2.0-2.9)**: Monitor closely, proactive management needed
- **Low (1.0-1.9)**: Normal monitoring, no immediate action required
- **Minimal (0.0-0.9)**: Negligible risk, routine monitoring

## Mitigation Strategies

### Automated Recommendations
- **Maintenance Risk**: Schedule preventive maintenance, budget allocation
- **Churn Risk**: Implement retention programs, improve tenant satisfaction
- **Market Risk**: Adjust pricing strategy, diversify property portfolio
- **Financial Risk**: Review insurance coverage, implement cost controls
- **Operational Risk**: Staff training, process improvements, technology upgrades

### Risk Mitigation Tracking
- Mitigation action assignment and tracking
- Progress monitoring and effectiveness measurement
- Cost-benefit analysis of mitigation strategies
- Historical mitigation success rate analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Integration
- Integrates with existing analytics services from Stories 21.1-21.4
- Uses shared data models and API patterns
- Implements caching for performance optimization
- Supports real-time risk updates for critical situations

### Data Sources
- **Internal Data**: Property records, tenant information, financial data
- **External Data**: Market trends, economic indicators, industry benchmarks
- **Predictive Data**: Maintenance predictions, churn probabilities, market forecasts
- **Historical Data**: Past performance, risk events, mitigation outcomes

### Performance Requirements
- Risk assessment calculation: <30 seconds for portfolio
- Real-time risk updates: <5 seconds for individual assessments
- Dashboard load time: <3 seconds
