# Story 21.5: User Acceptance Testing

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a product owner,
I want stakeholders and beta users to validate Epic 21 features in staging environment,
So that I can confirm the features meet business requirements and user expectations before production deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. UAT test plan created covering all Epic 21 features and user scenarios
2. Key stakeholders (property managers, tenants, administrators) participate in UAT
3. All critical user journeys tested and validated
4. Feedback collected on usability, functionality, and performance
5. Any UAT issues documented and prioritized
6. UAT sign-off obtained from primary stakeholders
7. Existing staging functionality verified during UAT
8. UAT results documented and shared with development team
9. Go/no-go decision made based on UAT outcomes

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:** Staging deployment completed successfully; UAT validates user acceptance.

**Data Models:** Use staging data that mirrors production for realistic testing.

**API Specifications:** All endpoints must be fully functional for UAT scenarios.

**Component Specifications:** UI components must be tested across different devices and browsers.

**File Locations:** UAT test scripts and scenarios documented in docs/uat/

**Testing Requirements:** User journey tests, usability testing, performance validation under user load.

**Technical Constraints:** UAT environment must remain stable, test data must be realistic but not sensitive, feedback collection system in place.
