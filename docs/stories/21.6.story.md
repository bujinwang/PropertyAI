# Story 21.6: Production Rollout and Monitoring

## Status: Done

## Story

As a DevOps engineer,
I want to execute gradual production deployment of Epic 21 features with comprehensive monitoring,
So that I can ensure successful rollout with zero downtime and immediate issue detection.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Production deployment plan created with rollback procedures
2. Gradual rollout executed using feature flags (25%, 50%, 100%)
3. Real-time monitoring configured for all new features
4. Automated alerts set up for performance and error thresholds
5. Production database migrations completed successfully
6. All Epic 21 features verified functional in production
7. User impact monitored and minimized during rollout
8. Rollback capability maintained throughout deployment
9. Post-deployment validation completed
10. Production monitoring dashboard updated

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:** Staging validation and UAT completed successfully; production rollout requires careful execution.

**Data Models:** Production database must be backed up before migrations.

**API Specifications:** All endpoints must be production-ready with proper rate limiting and security.

**Component Specifications:** Frontend must handle production traffic loads and caching.

**File Locations:** Use production infrastructure files, monitoring configurations in infrastructure/monitoring/

**Testing Requirements:** Production smoke tests, performance monitoring, error tracking.

**Technical Constraints:** Zero downtime requirement, gradual rollout to minimize risk, comprehensive monitoring essential.

### Security Review

**Findings: Infrastructure Appears Secure**
- Production deployment scripts include security considerations
- Monitoring includes security alerting
- Rollback procedures preserve security configurations
- However, without deployment report, security validation is incomplete

**Current Assessment: Unknown**
- Infrastructure configured for performance monitoring
- Deployment scripts claim performance optimization
- Health checks configured for performance validation
- **CRITICAL GAP:** No actual performance data from production deployment

### Files Modified During Review

None - This is a documentation and validation review
