# Story 23.2: Intelligent Alert Grouping

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a property manager,  
I want alerts grouped by type/priority/property,  
so that I can quickly triage issues without overload.

## Context Source
- Source Document: Epic 23 PRD (docs/prd/requirements.md FR2, ui-enhancement-goals.md)
- Enhancement Type: UI/UX Overhaul
- Existing System Impact: Moderate - modifies existing alert components for grouping without breaking real-time feeds.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Alerts grouped by type (maintenance, churn, market) and priority, with customizable filters (e.g., by property or severity).
2. Visual indicators (colors, badges) for priority; support collapse/expand for groups.
3. Integration with existing alerts (ChurnRiskAlerts, MaintenanceAlerts) for seamless display.
4. Support 1000+ alerts/day with pagination and efficient querying.

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Existing alert feeds unchanged; grouping applied client/server-side as needed.
6. New functionality follows existing React patterns (e.g., list components in dashboard/src/components).
7. Integration with existing DB (use indexes on alert_type/priority) maintains query performance.

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Change covered by unit/integration tests (Jest for grouping logic).
9. Documentation updated in src/services/alerts/README.md for grouping API.
10. No regression in existing alert rendering verified (run Epic 21 alert tests).

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Extend AlertGroupingService to aggregate existing alerts; UI via new AlertGroupView component.
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow ChurnRiskAlerts.tsx structure; use existing color scheme for priorities.
- **Key Constraints:** Query time <2s for 1000 alerts; client-side grouping for small sets, server for large.

## Dev Technical Guidance
### Existing System Context
From Epic 23 Architecture: Existing alerts in src/models/Alert.js; services like marketDataService.ts for integration.

### Data Models
Extend existing Alert model with group_id FK; new AlertGroups model for aggregation. [Source: architecture-epic23.md#data-models]

### API Specifications
New GET /v2/epic23/alert-groups?filters; returns grouped data. Reuse GET /api/alerts for base. [Source: architecture-epic23.md#api-design]

### Component Specifications
- AlertGroupView.tsx: Renders groups with filters/collapse.
- Props: alerts (array), filters (object), onFilter (fn).

### File Locations
- dashboard/src/components/epic23/AlertGroupView.tsx (new)
- src/services/epic23/AlertGroupingService.js (new)
- Update dashboard/src/components/ChurnRiskAlerts.tsx, MaintenanceAlerts.tsx (add grouping).

### Testing Requirements
Unit: Jest for grouping algorithm; Integration: Test with existing alerts; E2E: Filter/collapse in Cypress. [Source: architecture-epic23.md#testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
Use existing Sequelize for queries; pagination with offset/limit; no new DB load on real-time.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create AlertGroups model and service (AC1,4)
  - [x] Define AlertGroups.js with relationships to Alert
  - [x] Implement AlertGroupingService.groupAlerts() with filters
  - [x] Add indexes for type/priority in migration
  - [x] Unit test service logic (Jest)
- [x] Task 2: Build AlertGroupView component (AC2,3)
  - [x] Implement collapse/expand with state
  - [x] Add visual badges/colors from existing theme
  - [x] Integrate filters (dropdown for type/severity)
  - [x] Unit test component rendering/interactions
- [x] Task 3: Integrate with existing components (AC3)
  - [x] Update ChurnRiskAlerts.tsx and MaintenanceAlerts.tsx to use AlertGroupView
  - [x] Add pagination for large groups
  - [x] Verify integration with existing alert feeds
  - [x] E2E test grouping display in Cypress
- [x] Task 4: Verify integration and performance (AC5-7,10)
  - [x] Run Epic 21 alert regression tests
  - [x] Load test with 1000 alerts (mock data)
  - [x] Measure query time (<2s)
  - [x] Update service README.md
- [x] Task 5: Add tests and documentation (AC8,9)
  - [x] Write integration tests for service with DB
  - [x] Ensure 100% coverage for new code
  - [x] Add JSDoc to service/component
  - [x] Document grouping API in rest-api-spec.md

## Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** Grouping logic overloads DB for large datasets.
- **Mitigation:** Server-side pagination; indexes on key fields; fallback to client-side for small sets.
- **Rollback:** Remove grouping wrapper; revert service calls to direct alerts.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable
