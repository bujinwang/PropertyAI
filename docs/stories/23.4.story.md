# Story 23.4: Historical Data Access

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a property manager,  
I want to view/query historical AI predictions and trends,  
so that I can analyze patterns over time.

## Context Source
- Source Document: Epic 23 PRD (docs/prd/requirements.md FR4, ui-enhancement-goals.md)
- Enhancement Type: New Feature Addition
- Existing System Impact: Low - adds historical tab to existing dashboards using existing data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Historical tab in dashboards (6-12 months data); support filter by date/property/type.
2. Trend charts (e.g., churn over time) integrated with market data visualizations.
3. Export historical reports as PDF/CSV; secure access role-based (managers only).
4. Query time <5s for 1-year range, with pagination for large datasets.

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Existing real-time dashboards unchanged; historical as optional view.
6. New functionality follows existing React/chart patterns (e.g., Recharts in MarketTrendsDashboard).
7. Integration with existing data (e.g., MaintenanceHistory.js) for backfill and queries.

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Change covered by unit/integration tests (Jest for queries, Cypress for UI).
9. Documentation updated in src/services/history/README.md for query API.
10. No regression in real-time analytics verified.

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** New HistoricalDataView component; service for querying/backfill from existing logs.
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow MarketTrendsDashboard.tsx for charts; use existing export utils.
- **Key Constraints:** Secure with role checks; backfill without downtime.

## Dev Technical Guidance
### Existing System Context
From Epic 23 Architecture: Existing models like MaintenanceHistory.js; services for AI predictions.

### Data Models
Extend existing with HistoricalLogs model (timestamped predictions). [Source: architecture-epic23.md#data-models]

### API Specifications
New GET /v2/epic23/historical?date_range&property_id; returns aggregated trends. Backfill endpoint POST /v2/epic23/backfill. [Source: architecture-epic23.md#api-design]

### Component Specifications
- HistoricalDataView.tsx: Tabbed view with filters/charts.
- Props: data (array), filters (object), onExport (fn).

### File Locations
- dashboard/src/pages/epic23/HistoricalDataView.tsx (new)
- src/services/epic23/HistoryService.js (new)
- src/models/epic23/HistoricalLogs.js (new)
- Update dashboard/src/pages/PredictiveMaintenanceDashboard.tsx (add tab).

### Testing Requirements
Unit: Jest for query aggregation; Integration: Test backfill with mock data; E2E: Filter/export in Cypress. [Source: architecture-epic23.md#testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
Use existing indexes for queries; limit to 12 months to avoid load; role auth via middleware.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create HistoricalLogs model and service (AC1,4)
  - [ ] Define HistoricalLogs.js with relationships to Prediction/Alert
  - [ ] Implement HistoryService.getHistorical() with filters/pagination
  - [ ] Add backfill script for Epic 21 data
  - [ ] Unit test service queries (Jest)
- [ ] Task 2: Build HistoricalDataView component (AC1,2)
  - [ ] Implement tab/filter UI with Recharts for trends
  - [ ] Add date picker and property selector
  - [ ] Integrate market data for charts
  - [ ] Unit test component with mock data
- [ ] Task 3: Integrate export and security (AC3)
  - [ ] Add PDF/CSV export using existing utils
  - [ ] Implement role-based access (middleware check)
  - [ ] Add tab to existing dashboards
  - [ ] E2E test view/export in Cypress
- [ ] Task 4: Verify integration and performance (AC5-7,10)
  - [ ] Run Epic 21 analytics regression tests
  - [ ] Load test queries (<5s for 1-year)
  - [ ] Verify backfill without downtime
  - [ ] Update service README.md
- [ ] Task 5: Add tests and documentation (AC8,9)
  - [ ] Write integration tests for backfill/DB
  - [ ] Ensure 100% coverage
  - [ ] Add JSDoc to service/component
  - [ ] Document query API in rest-api-spec.md

## Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** Historical queries overload DB or expose sensitive data.
- **Mitigation:** Pagination/indexes; role-based access; query limits.
- **Rollback:** Remove historical tab/service; no data changes.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable
