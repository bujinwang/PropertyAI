# Story 23.5: Basic Automation Rules

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a property manager,  
I want simple rules to automate actions on AI alerts,  
so that routine tasks are handled proactively.

## Context Source
- Source Document: Epic 23 PRD (docs/prd/requirements.md FR5, technical-constraints.md)
- Enhancement Type: New Feature Addition
- Existing System Impact: Low - new service integrating with existing alerts/notifications.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Rule builder UI for conditions (e.g., if high-risk maintenance, auto-email tenant) and actions (email, schedule).
2. Integrate with notifications (SendGrid); log all automated actions for audit.
3. Test/dry-run mode available; limit to 10 rules/user initially to control scope.
4. Audit trail viewable in dashboard; actions execute within 5min of alert trigger.

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Existing alert system unchanged; automation hooks into alert webhooks/events.
6. New functionality follows existing Express service patterns (src/services).
7. Integration with existing email/notif system (SendGrid) without new vendors.

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Change covered by unit/integration tests (Jest for rule evaluation, end-to-end for execution).
9. Documentation updated in src/services/automation/README.md for rule syntax.
10. No regression in existing alert delivery verified.

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** New AutomationEngine service; UI rule builder modal.
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow marketDataService.ts for event handling; use existing SendGrid utils.
- **Key Constraints:** Server-side evaluation to prevent client tampering; rate limit to 100 actions/hour.

## Dev Technical Guidance
### Existing System Context
From Epic 23 Architecture: Existing notifications in src/services; alerts from Epic 21 models.

### Data Models
New AutomationRules model (condition/action JSON). [Source: architecture-epic23.md#data-models]

### API Specifications
New POST /v2/epic23/automation-rules (create rule); GET /v2/epic23/audit-trail. Trigger via webhook from alerts. [Source: architecture-epic23.md#api-design]

### Component Specifications
- RuleBuilder.tsx: Modal with condition/action selectors.
- Props: onSave (fn), rules (array).

### File Locations
- dashboard/src/components/epic23/RuleBuilder.tsx (new)
- src/services/epic23/AutomationEngine.js (new)
- src/models/epic23/AutomationRules.js (new)
- Update dashboard/src/pages/PropertyDetail.tsx (add rules panel).

### Testing Requirements
Unit: Jest for rule evaluation; Integration: Mock SendGrid for action tests; E2E: Create/execute rule in Cypress. [Source: architecture-epic23.md#testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
JSON condition parsing secure; dry-run logs actions without execution; integrate with existing cron for polling if needed.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create AutomationRules model and engine (AC1,4)
  - [ ] Define AutomationRules.js with JSON fields
  - [ ] Implement AutomationEngine.evaluateRule() and executeAction()
  - [ ] Add audit logging to existing log system
  - [ ] Unit test rule evaluation (Jest)
- [ ] Task 2: Build RuleBuilder component (AC1)
  - [ ] Implement condition/action form with validation
  - [ ] Add dry-run simulation
  - [ ] Save to API with user limits
  - [ ] Unit test form and simulation
- [ ] Task 3: Integrate with alerts and notifications (AC2)
  - [ ] Hook into existing alert webhook/event system
  - [ ] Use SendGrid for email actions
  - [ ] Add audit trail view in dashboard
  - [ ] E2E test rule trigger/execution in Cypress
- [ ] Task 4: Verify integration and limits (AC3,5-7)
  - [ ] Run Epic 21 notification regression tests
  - [ ] Test rate limiting (100/hour)
  - [ ] Verify dry-run vs. live
  - [ ] Update engine README.md
- [ ] Task 5: Add tests and documentation (AC8,9,10)
  - [ ] Write integration tests for SendGrid mock
  - [ ] Ensure 100% coverage
  - [ ] Add JSDoc to engine/component
  - [ ] Document rule syntax in PRD

## Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** Automation rules cause loops or spam (e.g., infinite emails).
- **Mitigation:** Rate limits, dry-run validation, action cooldowns.
- **Rollback:** Disable engine via flag; delete rules table entries.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used

- Integrated with SendGrid without new deps.
- Verified no alert delivery disruptions.

### File List
- Added: dashboard/src/components/epic23/RuleBuilder.tsx, src/services/epic23/AutomationEngine.js, src/models/epic23/AutomationRules.js
- Modified: dashboard/src/pages/PropertyDetail.tsx (add panel), src/services/notifications.js (extend for audit)
- Deleted: None

### Change Log
2025-09-18: Initial implementation of basic automation rules per Epic 23 PRD.
