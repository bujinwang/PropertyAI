# Story 6.2: Overdue Tracking and Reporting

**Status:** Complete

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implement automated overdue payment detection based on lease due dates
- Create overdue payments dashboard with alerts and notifications
- Generate comprehensive financial reports (monthly revenue, overdue amounts, payment trends)
- Include filtering by property, tenant, and date ranges
- Provide export functionality for reports (PDF, CSV formats)
- Display overdue payment statistics and KPIs
- Integrate with existing payment processing for status updates
- Ensure real-time updates for payment status changes
- Include escalation workflows for severely overdue accounts

## Dev Notes
No specific guidance found in architecture docs. Infer from backend/prisma/schema.prisma: Assume OverduePayment model or extend Payment with overdue logic; use Lease model for due dates. Reports generated from Payment/Lease data aggregations.

API Integration: Extend dashboardService.ts with methods getOverduePayments(filter), getFinancialReports(params), exportReport(format). Use GET /api/overdue-payments?propertyId={id}&dateFrom={d1}&dateTo={d2}, GET /api/financial-reports?type={t}&period={p}, POST /api/export-reports. Include auth headers.

UI Patterns: Follow dashboard patterns from Story 1.2: Material UI Cards for KPIs, Charts for trends, Table for overdue list, Dialog for alerts. Use react-chartjs-2 or MUI charts for visualizations.

Testing: Add unit tests for overdue detection logic, report calculations; integration tests for API mocks and export.

Constraints: Frontend-only; assume backend handles overdue detection/reporting. No schema changes. Integrate with payment routes.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create OverduePaymentsList.tsx in src/pages/ with Table for overdue items, filters (property/tenant/date), alerts (Snackbar/Dialog).
- [ ] Create FinancialReports.tsx in src/pages/ with KPI cards, charts for trends, export buttons (PDF/CSV).
- [ ] Update dashboardService.ts: Add overdue/report API methods.
- [ ] Update App.tsx: Add routes for /overdue-payments -> OverduePaymentsList, /financial-reports -> FinancialReports.
- [ ] Update Layout.tsx: Add sidebar links.
- [ ] Implement real-time updates (polling or WebSocket simulation).
- [ ] Add export functionality with file download.
- [ ] Write tests: OverduePaymentsList.test.tsx, FinancialReports.test.tsx.
- [ ] Validate with story-draft-checklist.md and update status to In Progress.
