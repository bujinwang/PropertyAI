# Story 8.1: Tenant Messaging System

## Status
Complete

## Description
As a property manager, I want to send direct messages to tenants and manage message threads so that I can communicate effectively about maintenance, payments, lease updates, and other property-related matters.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Property managers can compose and send messages to individual tenants
- Property managers can send messages to tenant groups (by property, unit type, etc.)
- Message threads are maintained with conversation history
- Messages show read/unread status
- Messages can include attachments (documents, images)
- Inbox view shows all conversations with latest message preview
- Search functionality for messages and conversations
- Message delivery notifications
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Integration with existing tenant database
- Audit trail for all messages sent

## Dev Notes
- Aligns with Epic 8: Communication Tools brownfield enhancement
- Assumes Message/MessageThread models in Prisma schema with relations to Tenant/User
- API endpoints: /api/messages (CRUD), /api/message-threads, /api/message-attachments
- UI patterns: Follow Material UI Table/Dialog patterns from PropertyList/TenantList
- Constraints: Frontend-only implementation, no backend schema changes assumed
- Testing: Mock API responses, test message composition, thread display, attachment upload
- Security: Messages encrypted at rest, access controlled by tenant relations

## Tasks
- [ ] Create MessageInbox.tsx component with conversation list and search
- [ ] Create MessageThread.tsx component for conversation view
- [ ] Create MessageCompose.tsx component with tenant selection and attachment upload
- [ ] Update dashboardService.ts with message API methods
- [ ] Add /messages route to App.tsx and navigation to Layout.tsx
- [ ] Implement responsive design and accessibility features
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
- [ ] Test integration with existing tenant data

## Technical Requirements
- Secure message storage with encryption
- Rate limiting to prevent spam
- GDPR compliance for message retention
- Integration with existing authentication system
- Real-time message delivery (if possible) or email fallback
- File upload support for attachments
- Message templates for common communications
- Archive functionality for old conversations
- Export functionality for compliance

## Definition of Done
