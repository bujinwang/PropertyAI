# Token Validation & Session Handling Test Plan

This document outlines the test plan for token validation and session handling.

## 1. Token Validation

- **Test Case 1.1:** Valid tokens should be accepted by protected endpoints.
- **Test Case 1.2:** Invalid tokens (e.g., incorrect signature, malformed) should be rejected.
- **Test Case 1.3:** Expired tokens should be rejected.
- **Test Case 1.4:** The system should support token refresh (if applicable).

## 2. Session Handling

- **Test Case 2.1:** A new session should be created upon successful login.
- **Test Case 2.2:** The session should time out after a configured period of inactivity.
- **Test Case 2.3:** Users should be able to log out, which should invalidate the session.
- **Test Case 2.4:** All active sessions for a user should be invalidated upon password change.

## 3. Secure Storage

- **Test Case 3.1:** Tokens should be stored securely on the client-side (e.g., `localStorage` for web, `Keychain` for React Native).
- **Test Case 3.2:** Sensitive information should not be stored in a way that is easily accessible.
