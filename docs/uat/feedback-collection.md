# UAT Feedback Collection Process

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic process for collecting, analyzing, and acting on user feedback during Epic 21 User Acceptance Testing. The goal is to capture comprehensive insights from all stakeholders to validate feature quality and identify improvement opportunities.

## Feedback Collection Methods

### 1. Structured Survey Forms

#### Post-Scenario Feedback Form
**Timing**: After each test scenario completion
**Format**: Digital form with quantitative and qualitative questions

```json
{
  "scenario": "Predictive Maintenance Alert Management",
  "user": "sarah.johnson@propertyai.com",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-16T14:30:00Z",
  "ratings": {
    "ease_of_use": 4, // 1-5 scale
    "feature_value": 5,
    "accuracy": 4,
    "performance": 5,
    "overall_satisfaction": 4
  },
  "feedback": {
    "what_worked_well": "Alert details were very comprehensive and actionable",
    "what_needs_improvement": "Could use more visual indicators for urgency levels",
    "suggestions": "Add quick action buttons for common responses",
    "blocking_issues": "",
    "additional_comments": "Great feature for preventive maintenance"
  }
}
```

#### Daily Feedback Summary
**Timing**: End of each testing day
**Format**: Structured debrief session

```json
{
  "date": "2025-09-16",
  "user": "sarah.johnson@propertyai.com",
  "day_rating": 4,
  "key_findings": [
    "Predictive maintenance alerts are highly valuable",
    "Some alerts need better prioritization",
    "Mobile experience could be improved"
  ],
  "energy_level": "Good - Productive testing day",
  "blockers_encountered": "None",
  "recommendations": [
    "Consider alert grouping by urgency",
    "Add mobile-optimized alert views"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Real-Time Observation

#### Session Monitoring
**Method**: Live observation with note-taking
**Focus Areas**:
- User interaction patterns
- Points of confusion or hesitation
- Workarounds or unexpected behaviors
- Performance issues or delays
- Mobile responsiveness problems

#### Think-Aloud Protocol
**Process**:
1. User verbalizes thoughts during task completion
2. Observer notes key insights and pain points
3. Immediate clarification questions when needed
4. Capture both positive and negative experiences

### 3. Automated Data Collection

#### System Analytics
**Metrics Captured**:
- Feature usage patterns
- Error rates and types
- Performance metrics (load times, response times)
- User flow completion rates
- Session duration and engagement

#### User Interaction Tracking
**Data Points**:
- Click patterns and navigation paths
- Feature adoption rates
- Time spent on each feature
- Error recovery patterns
- Mobile vs desktop usage patterns

## Feedback Analysis Framework

### Quantitative Analysis

#### Rating Scale Interpretation
- **5 - Excellent**: Feature exceeds expectations
- **4 - Good**: Feature meets requirements well
- **3 - Acceptable**: Feature meets basic requirements
- **2 - Poor**: Feature has significant issues
- **1 - Unacceptable**: Feature is unusable or incorrect

#### Success Metrics
- **Feature Adoption**: % of users who successfully use each feature
- **Task Completion**: % of scenarios completed without assistance
- **Error Rate**: % of interactions that result in errors
- **Satisfaction Score**: Average rating across all users and scenarios

### Qualitative Analysis

#### Thematic Coding
**Common Themes**:
- **Usability Issues**: Navigation, workflow, interface design
- **Feature Gaps**: Missing functionality or capabilities
- **Performance Concerns**: Speed, responsiveness, reliability
- **Data Quality**: Accuracy, completeness, relevance
- **Integration Issues**: Cross-feature compatibility, data consistency

#### Severity Classification
- **Critical**: Blocks production deployment
- **Major**: Significant impact on user experience
- **Minor**: Cosmetic or enhancement opportunities
- **Enhancement**: Nice-to-have improvements

## Feedback Processing Workflow

### Phase 1: Collection (Real-time)
1. **Immediate Capture**: Record feedback as it occurs
2. **Context Preservation**: Note scenario, user role, and conditions
3. **Clarification**: Ask follow-up questions when needed
4. **Categorization**: Tag feedback by type and severity

### Phase 2: Analysis (Daily)
1. **Data Aggregation**: Combine feedback from all sources
2. **Pattern Identification**: Look for common themes and issues
3. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate business and technical impact
4. **Prioritization**: Rank issues by severity and frequency

### Phase 3: Action Planning (End of Testing)
1. **Issue Resolution**: Plan fixes for identified problems
2. **Enhancement Planning**: Design improvements based on feedback
3. **Timeline Development**: Create implementation schedule
4. **Communication**: Share findings with development team
