# Data Privacy & Compliance Center: Wireframes & User Flow

This document outlines the wireframes and user flow for the Data Privacy & Compliance Center in the PropertyFlow AI mobile application. The center is designed to provide users with transparent control over their personal data and ensure compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

## 1. Screen Structure

The Data Privacy & Compliance Center will be a single, scrollable screen, organized into clear sections using `Card` components.

- **Component:** `DataPrivacyComplianceScreen.tsx` will serve as the main container.
- **Navigation:** The screen will be accessible from the main settings or profile menu.
- **State Management:** A service, `privacyService.ts`, will manage the state and API interactions for the different privacy settings.

## 2. Dashboard Overview

**Objective:** Provide a quick, visual summary of the user's current privacy status.

**Wireframe:**
- **Title:** "Your Privacy Dashboard"
- **Components:**
    - A summary card that displays an overall privacy "score" or status (e.g., "Your data is well-protected").
    - Visual icons representing key privacy areas (e.g., consent, data retention) with their current status.

## 3. Consent Management

**Objective:** Give users granular control over how their data is used.

**Wireframe:**
- **Title:** "Consent Management"
- **Components:**
    - `ConsentManagement.tsx`: A component that lists different data usage categories (e.g., "Marketing Communications," "Personalized AI Features," "Third-Party Analytics").
    - Each category will have a toggle switch and a brief, clear explanation of what it entails.
- **Action:** Toggling a switch will update the user's consent preferences, with changes saved via `consentService.ts`.

## 4. AI Data Usage Transparency

**Objective:** Clearly explain how AI algorithms use user data.

**Wireframe:**
- **Title:** "AI & Your Data"
- **Components:**
    - `AIDataTransparency.tsx`: A component that provides a simple, easy-to-understand overview of how AI models use data to provide features like smart routing and predictive analytics.
    - It will link to a more detailed policy document for users who want more information.

## 5. Data Retention Policy

**Objective:** Inform users about how long their data is stored.

**Wireframe:**
- **Title:** "Data Retention"
- **Components:**
    - `DataRetention.tsx`: A component that visually represents the data retention timeline for different types of data (e.g., user profile, financial records, maintenance history).
- **Content:** Clear statements about data anonymization and deletion schedules.

## 6. Subject Access Requests (SAR)

**Objective:** Enable users to exercise their right to access and delete their data.

**Wireframe:**
- **Title:** "Your Data Rights"
- **Components:**
    - `SubjectAccessRequests.tsx`: A component with two primary actions:
        1.  **"Request My Data"**: A button that initiates a data export process.
        2.  **"Delete My Data"**: A button that allows a user to request account and data deletion.
- **Action:** Both actions will trigger a confirmation modal and be handled by `sarService.ts`.

## 7. Granular Privacy Settings

**Objective:** Offer advanced users more detailed control over their privacy.

**Wireframe:**
- **Title:** "Advanced Privacy Settings"
- **Components:**
    - `PrivacySettings.tsx`: A component that contains more specific privacy controls, such as:
        - Location data usage.
        - Advertising personalization.
        - Social media connections.
- **Structure:** These settings will be organized into collapsible sections to avoid overwhelming the user.

## 8. API and Service Integration

- **`privacyService.ts`**: A central service to manage all privacy-related state and API calls.
- **`consentService.ts`**: Handles fetching and updating user consent preferences.
- **`aiTransparencyService.ts`**: Provides content for the AI data usage section.
- **`dataRetentionService.ts`**: Provides information on data retention policies.
- **`sarService.ts`**: Manages the submission of Subject Access Requests.
- **Backend API:** Endpoints will be required for each of the above services to function correctly.
