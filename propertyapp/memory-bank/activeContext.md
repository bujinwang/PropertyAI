# Active Context: React Native 0.80.2 Upgrade

**Current Focus:** Resolving dependency issues and verifying the upgrade.

**Recent Changes:**
*   Updated `package.json` with the correct dependencies for React Native 0.80.2.
*   Installed the updated dependencies using `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.
*   Corrected the favicon path in `app.json`.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Restart the Metro bundler to apply the changes.
2.  Verify that the application loads correctly in the browser.
3.  Address any remaining TypeScript errors or runtime issues.
4.  Build and test the application on iOS and Android.

**Decisions and Considerations:**
*   The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag was necessary to resolve the dependency conflicts.
*   The `write_to_file` tool was used to ensure the `package.json` was updated correctly.
