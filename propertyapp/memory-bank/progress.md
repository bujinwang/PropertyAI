# Progress: Tenant Rating Feature

**Completed:**
*   **Backend API:**
    *   Created `tenantRating.controller.ts` to handle API requests.
    *   Created `tenantRating.service.ts` to manage business logic.
    *   Created `tenantRating.routes.ts` to define API endpoints.
    *   Integrated the new routes into `app.ts`.

    *   Created `tenantRating.api.ts` to communicate with the backend.
    *   Created `tenantRating.ts` to define the data type.

**Next Steps:**
